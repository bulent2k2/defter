There are two kinds of symmetric devices in general:
- a self symmetric (SS) device (or two or more abutted devices e.g.,
  for a common-centroid pair)
- symmetric pair (SP) of devices (with a gap in the active layer (diffusion
  or rpo, e.g.)

There are three "minimal" configurations that we need to identify in
layout. Otherwise, there is no symmetry. They are:

1- at least two SS 
2- at least two SP
3- at least one SS and one SP 

Let's denote them using the general term: a symmetry group (SG). So, an SG,
by definition has at a minimum two SS's, or one SP. In general, an SG can
have multiple SS's and SP's that make up a portion of the layout.

Given an SG, we also talk about "elements" of the SG. For two SS's, each SS
device is an element. For an SP, each device is an element.

The requirement for case 1 (at least two SS's):
- for vertical (horizontal) devices, SS1 and SS2 are stacked vertically
  (horizontally). We want the tool to check that their centerlines are
  aligned. I.e., they have the same coordinate. e.g., y=10u for vertical
  devices. 

The requirement for case 2 (at least one SP):
- for vertical (horizontal) devices, the top and bottom (left and right)
  edges of the "left-hand" (bottom-side) device, denote as M(LB) are
  aligned with those edges of the "right-hand" (top-side) device, denote as
  M(RT). 

The requirement for case 3 (one SP and one SS):
- for vertical (horizontal) devices, the top and bottom (left and right)
edges are aligne for the SP and the centerline of the SS is aligned with
the centerline of the SP.

Further, in all three cases, we want the elements (devices) of the symmetry
group to be in close "proximity." I.e., if we query the neighborhood of one
element of the SG, the resulting set of immediate neighbors, just denote it
as "neighbor" must include the other element. 

In case of multiple elements in an SG, consider the following cases:

1- three or more SS: first find the closest pair of elements. Now, one of
   the remaining elements must be a "neighbor" of the first pair. And, so
   on, for fourth element and on..

2- two or more SP: first find the SP for which the two elements are
   neightbors. Now, from the remaining SPs, at least one must have one
   element of the first SP as a "neighbor." And, so on for the third SP and
   on. 

3- mixed SP, SS: first find the SP or SS with the closest elements. If it
   is an SS (as in case 1), then find an SS, or SP, for which the elements
   are closest to the first SS, and continue.


So, we want the tool to automatically identify SS and SPs in layout using
"neighborhood" and "edge alignment" in the sense described above.



For vertical devices, we have the following minimal configurations (or,
there is no symmetry in layout):
