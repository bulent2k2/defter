Here is a quick re-write that should improve things, I hope :-):

The Partition constraint supports the specification of an optional "custom" spacing value. Please see the section on [hyperlink: "Custom Spacing."]

Please add "Custom Spacing" as a new section at the end of Chapter 5 and insert hyperlinks from all the other relevant constraints (listed below) to that section, too.

Section: "Custom Spacing"

Instead of using smart DRC based spacing, Custom Spacing feature allows the user to provide a minium spacing value to space the components in the constraint. The method to compute the "boundary" of the components is also an option and it can be controlled or programmed by the user.

This feature is supported by the following:
 - Top-level, Partition
 - Column, Row, AlignedArray, PNStack
 - Matrix, VMatrix (as two alternatives: CustomSpacingInRows/InColumns)

Custom Spacing has two main options: 
 1) Value (defaults to 0): This is the minimum spacing value to be used between components. It also supports negative values.
 2) Spacing Method (defaults to PRBoundary). This supports three other methods: 
    - Include Layers: This list of layers are used to compute the boundary of each component.
    - Exclude Layers: This list specifies the layers which should not be used to compute the boundary of each component.
    - Custom: Has two sub-entries: Custom Function and Custom Parameters. 
      Custom Function specifies the name of a Python module and function. This function will need to return a computed boundary for a given component. The function parameters can be optionally provided using the Custom Parameters entry. It expects a Python Dictionary of argument names and values. 
   Spacing Method also provides a control named CorrectAfterForDRC. When selected, the engine will check to see whether the spacing value provided by the user causes any design rule violations. If so, it will increase the spacing as much as needed to correct the violations.

              mapping:
                Value:
                  type: number
                  optional: yes
                IncludeLayers:
                  sequence:
                    type: str
                  optional: yes
                ExcludeLayers:
                  sequence:
                    type: str
                  optional: yes
                PRBoundary:
                  oneof: ['true', 'false']
                  optional: yes
                Function:
                  type: str
                  optional: yes
                Params:
                  type: map
                  optional: yes
                CorrectAfterForDRC:

* STAR: 9000861621- Multi Row PNStack constraint cannot be created from Helix GUI

Hi Ming,

Please assign to Noida team to add two params to the GUI. 

Here is the GUI spec:

MinRows/MaxRows -> Add to the General tab. Defaults to 1/1. Valid values: 0+natural numbers. Here, Row refers to a pair of device rows: one PRow + one NRow. So, a value of 2 would give us 4 rows of devices/instances.. 

Please let me know if there are any questions.

2.0 out of 5 stars Focused on the Past he was Oblivious to the Elephant Herd Approaching From Behind. December 10, 2014
By rain cloud
Format:Hardcover
Durant begins by saying, "Vanity increases with age."

Well, maybe that's true for celebrated authors, wined, dined, feted, and famous. For most people the aging process is an endless series of insults to the ego. For most of us aging grinds down ego and gives birth to compassion and understanding for other human beings caught in the bewilderment of being human.

That's the first clue to what part of the problem is with looking to Durant for some sort of ultimate insight.

One could say the real post-modern world began with the new physics. That could be symbolized by Einstein if you like, since humans feel good about putting a human face on things. But to my mind, it is really epitomized by the discovery of what is called
"quantum non-locality," which is a phenomenon that's been around so long that even Einstein himself called it, "spooky behavior at a distance."

It's just this. If you take two subatomic particles and put them together, then separate them, what you then do to one of them the other reacts to.

Why is that a big deal? It seems to prove (over and over) that there is something that transcends everything and joins everything together.

Well, so what?

It reminds me of the skeptic who said, "It (quantum non-locality, spooky behavior at a distance) has absolutely no bearing on day-to-day human life."

I read that and laughed out loud. Because, dear friend, if you have read several of these Will Durant tomes, like I have, you know that, if there's one thing that matters to human beings, it is how they define themselves, how they think about what they are. Not to mention how they think about the universe.

If they believe in the devil they burn millions of people as witches. (And if you don't think that's a big deal, go ask some of the people who got burned).

So, if there is something that transcends everything and joins all of us together and also joins us to that most distant star in the universe, that is a big deal to all of us.

But what is it that joins us all together? And what in hell does this have to do with Will Durant's book of final insights?

Just this. The best answer I've ever found to this question doesn't come from these western philosophies that Durant is pickled in but from a completely different one to which he was totally oblivious. There is (forgive me) a Buddhist philosophy called mahamudra that says something startlingly modern sounding about this.

Einstein said space and time are one fabric joined together and can't be separated. In Buddhist mahamudra they say the same thing, only they say he left something out.

They say that, like space and time, CONSCIOUSNESS and space are joined together and can't be separated. That consciousness is not produced by a brain but is only transformed by it, that consciousness is actually inherent in space.

And that space-time-consciousness is the "spooky" thing that joins us all together.

(Einstein said space was not a nothingness but, for example, that gravity works because the earth displaces the space around it. So, how can you displace "nothingness"?)

Likewise in mahamudra, they say that consciousness is also not a nothingness but is joined to space and that mind (your mind, my mind, your baby's mind, Durant's mind) has a "space-nature" and therefore that mind is actually indestructible because it is primarily space.

Durant, of course, was oblivious to all of this. He was focused only on the past of western civilization. He didn't notice the two things that are the most important developments in the post-modern western world: the development of physics and the arrival of Buddhism in the west.

It's happening at a very real grass roots level. It's like a trickle of water working its way through the grass that eventually turns into a flood. It's like standing in New Orleans in the hours after Katrina and not noticing the gradually rising of water until its up to about knee-level. And it's only going up from here.

Oh, it's not just Buddhism but also Advaita Vedanta and some forms of Sufism. It's new philosophies from non-western sources.

Durant knew none of this but still thought figures like "Sartre" were relevant. That's all being made obsolete by things like Buddhism (the most psychological of all religions or the most religious of all psychologies, depending on your point-of-view).

Durant is a man born in the 1800's and it shows.

I'm sure he was a good person and had some good insights.

I remember once I was listening to another of his summing up type books on audio while driving and he said something like, "The weak want social programs while the strong long only for freedom." I almost drove off of the road.

This sounded like the thoughts of someone lucky as a rock star, powdered and placed gingerly on a pillow at a very early age. He hit it big with his first book, "The Story of Philosophy" and made a fortune. That hopelessly drifted him away from the experience of ordinary people. He was a butterfly caught in a golden cage.

That's why I find his views hopelessly limited in more ways than one.

Now I'm sure you will want to drag me to the edge of the village and stone me, but everyone is entitled to their point-of-view, even the weak like me, who want social programs.

If I've offended you, I apologize.

you can not change the MAC address in the license. You need to request

Channeling Ram Dass
By Andrea Sachs 	 Monday, Apr. 21, 2003

In his book The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment, Eckhart
Tolle, 54, describes how he passed through suicidal depression to spiritual
bliss. Imagine his bliss when he discovered that his book had been endorsed
by Oprah. Her relentless touting has helped Tolle's book build a cult
following since its publication four years ago. Now in its 20th printing,
with 800,000 copies sold, it has spent four months on the New York Times
best-seller list. 

What is Tolle telling readers that they seem so eager to hear? His Zen-like
message, reminiscent of that of hippie guru Ram Dass, is that happiness is
achieved by living in the present: "In the Now, in the absence of time, all
your problems dissolve." But the book, awash in spiritual mumbo jumbo ("The
good news is that you can free yourself from your mind"), will be unhelpful
for those looking for practical advice. Of course, Meg Ryan loved it, and
Cher says it changed her life. Hooray for Hollywood. --By Andrea Sachs

* Stochastic Electronics: A Neuro-Inspired Design Paradigm for Integrated Circuits
IC design when noise is high.. using stochastic facilitation
[ ] Title: Stochastic Electronics: A Neuro-Inspired Design Paradigm for Integrated Circuits
by Hamilton, T. J.; Afshar, S.; van Schaik, A.; Tapson, J.; -- pp. 843-859
Ref#: 76192710IE
http://www.ieonline.com/cgi-bin/sfxR/ZHM/76192710
** Abstract: 
As advances in integrated circuit (IC) fabrication technology reduce feature sizes to dimensions on the order of nanometers, IC designers are facing many of the problems that evolution has had to overcome in order to perform meaningful and accurate computations in biological neural circuits. In this paper, we explore the current state of IC technology including the many new and exciting opportunities “beyond CMOS.” We review the role of noise in both biological and engineered systems and discuss how “stochastic facilitation” can be used to perform useful and precise computation. We explore nondeterministic methodologies for computation in hardware and introduce the concept of stochastic electronics (SE); a new way to design circuits and increase performance in highly noisy and mismatched fabrication environments. This approach is illustrated with several circuit examples whose results demonstrate its exciting potential.

Global ageing
A billion shades of grey

An ageing economy will be a slower and more unequal one—unless policy starts changing now
Apr 26th 2014 | The Economist 

WARREN BUFFETT, who on May 3rd hosts the folksy extravaganza that is Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholders’ meeting, is an icon of American capitalism (see article). At 83, he also epitomises a striking demographic trend: for highly skilled people to go on working well into what was once thought to be old age. Across the rich world, well-educated people increasingly work longer than the less-skilled. Some 65% of American men aged 62-74 with a professional degree are in the workforce, compared with 32% of men with only a high-school certificate. In the European Union the pattern is similar.

This gap is part of a deepening divide between the well-educated well-off and the unskilled poor that is slicing through all age groups. Rapid innovation has raised the incomes of the highly skilled while squeezing those of the unskilled. Those at the top are working longer hours each year than those at the bottom. And the well-qualified are extending their working lives, compared with those of less-educated people (see article). The consequences, for individuals and society, are profound.

Older, wiser and a lot of them

The world is on the cusp of a staggering rise in the number of old people, and they will live longer than ever before. Over the next 20 years the global population of those aged 65 or more will almost double, from 600m to 1.1 billion. The experience of the 20th century, when greater longevity translated into more years in retirement rather than more years at work, has persuaded many observers that this shift will lead to slower economic growth and “secular stagnation”, while the swelling ranks of pensioners will bust government budgets.

But the notion of a sharp division between the working young and the idle old misses a new trend, the growing gap between the skilled and the unskilled. Employment rates are falling among younger unskilled people, whereas older skilled folk are working longer. The divide is most extreme in America, where well-educated baby-boomers are putting off retirement while many less-skilled younger people have dropped out of the workforce.

Policy is partly responsible. Many European governments have abandoned policies that used to encourage people to retire early. Rising life expectancy, combined with the replacement of generous defined-benefit pension plans with stingier defined-contribution ones, means that even the better-off must work longer to have a comfortable retirement. But the changing nature of work also plays a big role. Pay has risen sharply for the highly educated, and those people continue to reap rich rewards into old age because these days the educated elderly are more productive than their predecessors. Technological change may well reinforce that shift: the skills that complement computers, from management expertise to creativity, do not necessarily decline with age.

This trend will benefit not just fortunate oldies but also, in some ways, society as a whole. Growth will slow less dramatically than expected; government budgets will be in better shape, as high earners pay taxes for longer. Rich countries with lots of well-educated older people will find the burden of ageing easier to bear than places like China, where half of all 50-to-64-year-olds did not complete primary-school education.

At the other end of the social scale, however, things look grim. Manual work gets harder as people get older, and public pensions look more attractive to those on low wages and the unemployed. In the lexicon of popular hate-figures, work-shirking welfare queens breeding at the taxpayer’s expense may be replaced by deadbeat grandads collecting taxpayer handouts while their hard-working contemporaries strive on.

Nor are all the effects on the economy beneficial. Wealthy old people will accumulate more savings, which will weaken demand. Inequality will increase and a growing share of wealth will eventually be transferred to the next generation via inheritance, entrenching the division between winners and losers still further.

One likely response is to impose higher inheritance taxes. So long as they replaced less-fair taxes, that might make sense. They would probably encourage old people to spend their cash rather than salt it away. But governments should focus not on redistributing income but on generating more of it by reforming retirement and education.

Age should no longer determine the appropriate end of a working life. Mandatory retirement ages and pension rules that discourage people from working longer should go. Welfare should reflect the greater opportunities open to the higher-skilled. Pensions should become more progressive (ie, less generous to the rich). At the same time, this trend underlines the importance of increasing public investment in education at all stages of life, so that more people acquire the skills they need to thrive in the modern labour market. Today, many governments are understandably loth to spend money retraining older folk who are likely to retire soon. But if people can work for longer, that investment makes much more sense. Deadbeat 60-year-olds are unlikely to become computer scientists, but they could learn useful vocational skills, such as caring for the growing number of very old people.

Old power
How likely are governments to make these changes? Look around the rich world today, and it is hard to be optimistic. The swelling ranks of older voters, and their disproportionate propensity to vote, have left politicians keener to pander to them than to implement disruptive reforms. Germany, despite being the fastest-ageing country in Europe, plans to cut the statutory retirement age for some people (see article). In America both Social Security (the public pension scheme) and the fast-growing system of disability benefits remain untouched by reform. Politicians need to convince less-skilled older voters that it is in their interests to go on working. Doing so will not be easy. But the alternative—economic stagnation and even greater inequality—is worse.
* Ross PP
Ross, 

Thanks for the note.

Please rest assured: you and I are in the same camp regarding usability. Now the challenge, for me, is to figure out what specific obstacles we need to eliminate in order to make PP easier to use (PNStack is another matter, but that's on my plate, too!) I do appreciate getting your continuous help, hearing your questions and concerns along the way. 

You said you did not know how to set Xgrid/Ygrid. I think the underlying concern is to get clean DRC with a basic/solid and easy-to-use flow. Did I get it right? Any other concerns?

I am adding a new section to the document to demonstrate a sample/basic usage example. If I can get MS Word to cooperate (it has been repeatedly crashing on me! :-(), I'll update the function-spec and send it your way soon. It won't solve world hunger, but it will be one tiny step.. 

Regards,
Bulent

* Dilemma, troi-lemma
** Yakov 
Going forward, I have a suggestion that I would like us to consider sooner rather than later. I briefly mentioned this to Mirko when we talked over the phone.

I see RectilinearPartition as an extension of Partition. I would like to have it be encapsulated under Partition and, if possible, get it turned on automatically by detecting percentage whitespace within sub-elements . Of course, we can have controls to choose one or the other strictly (as in abutment option in Row: auto1, auto2, etc..). This may be needed because of different DRC support models. XGrid and YGrid options can be easily added to core Partition constraint, I think, and that would enable a unique mode of operation (I expect that would run much faster on bigger designs). Alternatively, we could think about it as a GriddedPartition.  

I see PackedPartition as a FastPartition (just like FastSpice is to Spice) with the added bonuses of symmetry and rectilinear packing support. I would like it to also be encapsulated under Partition, and get turned on automatically by detecting whitespace and also estimating the complexity of the design (just a threshold based on how many elements there are in the ucell may be sufficient)..

These are rough ideas.. But, I think, it would really benefit the customer/user to see a simple/unified interface for Partition (instead of Partition, RP and/or PP), but also be able to quickly evolve to support large/complex designs which require symmetry and rectilinear packing.. There are other corner cases that we can discuss further when we talk on the phone. (How about a small design that needs symmetry, but also has detailed DRC issues? That’s probably for Pattern constraint to solve, and many other questions to consider further)..

But, again, I think we have an opportunity here to unify/simplify the interface (with one enhanced Partition constraint), while at the same time provide the expert user with new powerful features.. 


This will also help us internally in various ways:
1-	provide a smooth transition to users from Partition to RectilinearPartiton to PackedPartition, and make that available now,
2-	eliminate the need to duplicate the code in GUI code and python code,
3-	eliminate the need to duplicate the documentation,
4-	finally, eliminate the need to do a complex and expensive two way comparison study to measure RP vs PP. I think RP and PP are unique and complimentary implementations for a complex global optimization problem. It is very likely that there will always be test cases when one would beat the other, or one would fail and the other would provide a result so the customer is kept satisfied. Also, RP is more robust/reliable in the short term (because it is built directly on the Santana/Helix infrastructure) and PP is fast and capable of solving the symmetry problem..

Please let me know your thoughts. Or, if you prefer to talk, please feel free to call me.
** Mirko
1)	Let’s have a PackedPartition constraint with n elements, e0, e1, …, e(n-1). 
2)	Let’s denote masters of these elements with m0,m1,…,m(n-1). 
3)	In general, some masters will have a cell boundary shape (oaPrBoundary type, rectangle or a polygon), and others won’t. 
4)	For each m(i) without a cell boundary, OverlapLayers will be used to determine the whitespace as per spec.
5)	For each m(j) with a cell boundary, OverlapLayers will be ignored. In this case, does Intel expect to have whitespace __INSIDE__ the cell boundary where other elements should be placed?
6)	If not, we are in good shape. 
7)	Otherwise (there is whitespace inside boundary shape), the current workaround would be to DELETE the cell boundary shape, or adjust it so that it leaves the whitespace out.

** Nishath and Ming,

First, I would like to describe the current state of Partition related constraints in Helix to help bring us on the same plate. Then, I would like to describe three alternative proposals that we can proceed with. Please let me know your inputs.

1) We have an apparent dilemma where it seems like we need to choose between RectilinearPartition (RP) vs PackedPartition (PP), two seemingly alternative implementations to meet Intel's challenge in the short term. 

2) In the long term, I think we have a bigger opportunity to unify three different solutions: PP, RP and Partition, the original solution for general placement problem. More on the in the next bullet. Also, this opportunity is a lower hanging fruit than it appears. More on that later on..

3) Partition: Helix has a general purpose placement constraint called "Partition". It groups a set of elements (sub-constraints or sub-cells) which are placed using a global optimization algorithm (genetic algorithm/evolutionary search). Its advantages are the following:
  a) It is very easy to use: just group elements and run. No options are required to be set by the user.
  b) It is robust and consistent with other Helix constraints like Row, Column, Pattern, Matrix, etc.. It does the job in most cases..
However, it also has a number of serious drawbacks:
  c) It is rather slow (due to a scalar global optimization flow and frequent calls to DRC api) and is not the right solution for large designs. It doesn't scale well.
  d) It does not support symmetry at the moment. Yakov claims that it is a serious limitation. I think there are ways to add symmetry support to it, but, I agree that it is an open-ended challenge. (Apparently, nobody even wrote a paper on symmetric placement with sequence pair).
  e) It does not pack into whitespace within its sub-elements (Intel's requirement).

4) RectilinearPartition constraint (RP) is a variant on Partition described above. It uses the same core algorithm. It alleviates somewhat the limitation described in (e). However, it not only suffers from all the other drawbacks of Partition (e.g., it is slow and won't scale), but also has limitations w.r.t. how it models macro (sub-element) layout and polygon shapes. On the positive side, it is also consistent with other Helix constraints and can be made more robust very quickly. It could  be a solution customers rely on for smaller circuits when they don't need automated symmetry support.

5) PackedPartition constraint (PP) is a very different implementation. It has a distinct set of advantages and disadvantages. First, the single/major drawback:
  a) Integration layer between AVP and Helix is rather heavy and slows things down. However, most of the kinks have been worked out and both runtime and code fix time has no major issues.
  It has many advantages:
  b) Very likely the fastest engine in the industry. In limited testing, and even in very small tests, we have seen major speed up versus RP. It uses fast lookup tables and caching to speed up DRC checks, and a complex optimization flow to combine both global and local optimization techniques effectively.
  c) Very likely the most optimal engine in the industry. Complex flow underneath divides the problem into three logical phases: 1) force-driven global placement optimization to handle large-scale problems very fast and with global optimality, 2)  detailed placement phase to handle lower granularity optimization, 3) fast compaction phase to iron out wasted space.
  d) Support for automated symmetric constraints


Given the state as I see it above, I think a very promising option is to let both implementations (PP and RP) live while we engage with customers. There is the apparent disadvantage of seeming duplicate work, however, as tool providers, we can benefit from this as follows:

1)	When one seg faults (happened with test-case /slowfs/cdes1/bulent/helix/test/part/old/test_snapshot_1.tgz), the other works.
2)	When one does not finish (too long to run), the other finishes in minutes.
3)	Rectilinear impl is consistent with Helix and has expected behavior. Will work more robustly for smaller and simpler test-cases.
4)	Packed impl uses state-of-the-art optimization flow for very fast and accurate packing considering fixed custom/complex layout input from user..
5)	Rectilinear, in short term, would be more consistent with other helix constraints, whereas Packed would enable symmetry (which is not, and according to Yakov, cannot be, supported by Partition or PackedPartition)

From the customers’ perspective, we can make things seamless and also more feature rich:
a)	unify all three implementations under one constraint name (Partition). 
b)	Provide a constraint option (bool RectilinearPacking) to switch from old, trusted, true Partition to new RectilinearPartition implementation. This by default is off, so customers use Partition as before.
c)	Provide another constraint option (bool FastPacking) to switch from RectilinearPartition to PackedPartition.

I think this makes a lot of sense from a designer’s perspective. They can stay with default Partition for most designs. But, if they have a large design, they can switch on FastPacking (that will run PackedPartition). If they have rectilinear packing needs they can switch on RectilinearPacking (use Yakov’s impl), and optionally also switch on FastPacking (to use AVP). If they need symmetry, we can also add a SymmetryGroup option and that would also switch on FastPacking internally and use AVP. 

This is just a quick spec to give you a feel. I am sure we can improve on it, and make it even more seemless (one idea is to hide the FastPacking option, but switch from one impl to the other automatically when the former fails.)

Second option is to proceed with the comparison as you originally expected. To drive it to a closure, I would like to do the following:

1-	We ask both Joe and Yakov to provide 5 distinct test cases each to showcase the advantages of their respective implementations. 
2-	I will add 5 other surprise tests.
3-	I will tweak all test-cases in a couple of dimensions and compile a total of 45 tests (5 from Joe, 5 from Yakov, 5 from me, + 30 variants).
4-	I will run them with the latest engineering build and create tables to compare:
a.	run-time
b.	drc
c.	area
d.	wirelength
e.	layout quality (good, ok, bad)
f.	pareto front alternatives

There are potentially other things to add to this list. I am open to adding more criteria as requested by Yakov or Joe. At most two by each to limit the total effort spent on this..


Finally, our third option is to go ahead with both options1 and 2 concurrently! We can unify and benefit from three implementations (all under Partition constraint), and in parallel, compare and contrast the two new implementations to help improve both as needed.

Please let me know your inputs.

Are Humans Out of Place in the Modern World?

An exclusive from GOOD Magazine's Human Possibility Issue.

Sea turtles can have a hard time in the modern world. When hatchlings are born on the beach, they instinctively head toward the brightest part of the horizon. They developed this instinct over millennia because the brightest part of the horizon had always been the ocean, where light reflected off the water. These days, this instinct often leads them astray. In developed areas, they head toward brightly lit beach houses or coastal roads instead.

This is a case of so-called evolutionary mismatch, when traits that evolved in one environment have negative consequences in another. The turtles’ instinct works well in a natural environment, without artificial light. In a man-made environment, it is often fatal.

“Things like that are just so striking—they cause the organism to do suicidal things—that they’re just begging for our attention,” says David Sloan Wilson, an evolutionary biologist at Binghamton University. What concerns Wilson and a growing number of other evolutionary biologists, neuroscientists, and psychologists, is how evolutionary mismatch might be affecting humans.

Until about 12,000 years ago, our ancestors lived in small, pre-agricultural communities, where they hunted, fished, and foraged for food. Then, in the blink of an eye—in evolutionary terms—we went from hunting and gathering to agriculture, industry, and the information age. Today, for the first time in history, most of us live in urban centers, surrounded by man-made structures, completely immersed in the creations of our own culture. Our relationships are increasingly mediated by technology. Our work is often done seated, at a computer, using only our brains and our fingertips. Our diets are of our own design, free of natural constraints. It could hardly be a more different environment from the one our ancestors adapted to over the last 1.8 million years. Today’s world is rich in certain comforts—who doesn’t appreciate air conditioning or email—but it may fail to meet some of our more animal needs that have been evolving for millennia.

Some of the ways humans are ill-adapted to modern life are obvious. For example, we evolved in an environment where sugar, an important source of energy, was scarce. Because it was good for our ancestors to get sugar when they could, they developed a taste for it. But now sugar is everywhere, and we have a hard time turning down that cheap, enormous soft drink, even though we know it’s not good for us. Sometimes, however, the mismatch between the environment we evolved in and the one we live in plays out in less clear-cut ways.

The causes of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and its cousin, attention-deficit disorder, are poorly understood. Most researchers believe there are both genetic and environmental factors. And diagnosing ADHD is more art than science. Like many mental conditions, it expresses itself as an amorphous collection of symptoms and behaviors rather than, for example, the results of a simple score on a blood test. Treatment is difficult because medications don’t always work, and when they do they sometimes come with side effects or need to be taken for years.

In the summer of 2008, researchers from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, gathered a group of especially animated children—they all had been officially diagnosed with ADHD—and administered a simple treatment:  a 20-minute walk in a park.

The Urbana-Champaign team, led by Frances Kuo, a psychologist who studies how trees, green space, and other natural features affect human health, had read reports from parents who said their children’s ADHD symptoms seemed to improve when they participated in after-school programs that took place outdoors. Kuo and her team wanted to find out if these reported improvements were consistent. They started by giving each child a standard concentration test that involved listening to a sequence of numbers and then repeating it back in reverse order. Then they took them for walks. Some children were taken to a downtown area, others to a residential neighborhood, and a third group to a park. Then they were given the concentration test again.

The results were remarkable. The children who had taken walks in the downtown or residential areas showed no improvement in concentration. But those children who had taken a walk in the park showed improvements that effectively canceled out their ADHD. A 20-minute walk in a natural environment was about as effective as common ADHD medications, the team concluded.

Kuo and her team think that the kind of attention we need to sustain a close focus on a single activity—homework, for example—can be restored by spending time in an environment, like a park, where we pay attention in a more diffuse, passive way. Balancing those two forms of attention, they posit, is critical to keeping both mental states vital. As they put it in their report, “Environments that are gently absorbing and thus draw predominantly on involuntary attention can be restorative; exposure to such environments can allow the mechanism underlying directed attention to rest and rejuvenate.”

Our ancestors, of course, spent lots of time in “gently absorbing” environments. They lived primarily outdoors, with lots of downtime. If our brains evolved to function well in that environment, then they may, in this way at least, be poorly adapted to modern life, with its constant demands on our attention and limited opportunities to fully relax. The ADHD study suggests that reconnecting with that ancestral life is more important for our mental health in the modern world than we think.  

Indeed, our lack of contact with the natural world may be one of the most widespread forms of mismatch, with effects that go beyond ADHD. Evidence has been accumulating for years. In a 1984 study in Pennsylvania, gall bladder surgery patients were shown to recover more quickly when they could recuperate with a view of the outdoors. In a 1999 study, students who received lessons in rooms with more natural light scored up to 25 percent higher on standardized tests. (Ironically, for many years it was thought that limiting windows in classrooms would help prevent students from getting distracted.) A University of Kansas study from 2012 found that a four-day backpacking trip boosted scores on a commonly used creativity test by 50 percent.

In his book Last Child in the Woods, journalist and author Richard Louv coined the phrase “nature deficit disorder” to describe the problem. Louv has amassed mountains of research from all over the world documenting our increasing alienation from nature. In Norway, children spend less time in self-initiated play outdoors than they did in the previous years. In Australia, only 13 percent of children report playing outdoors more than indoors, compared with 73 percent of the prior generation.

The effects these massive changes are having on us are only beginning to be studied. Louv believes we don’t fully recognize the implications of our alienation from the natural world. “Nor,” he says, “do we fully understand the benefits and the costs of being immersed in technology all day. More research is coming in on that, too.”

Some of that research is coming from Peter Whybrow, a neuroscientist at UCLA. Whybrow argues that mechanisms in our brains, originally designed to deal with scarcity, can actually work against us in an environment abundant with food, information, and opportunity. “We have long been creating trouble for ourselves,” he says, “by creating mismatch between the culture which has been established since the industrial revolution and the evolution of our biology.”

Regions of the frontal cortex—the part of the human brain that keeps your impulses in check—help you resist the short-term urge to act rashly. Humans have a uniquely powerful ability to weigh long-term considerations when deliberating on a decision. But when the consequences to our urges seem low and the reward seems high, we tend to give in to our impulses. Whybrow contends that this is one of the effects of our dependence upon new technologies like social media. “Information is affluent at the moment because, increasingly, we can have these little gadgets which create an opportunity for us to do interesting things, and be amused by the novelty of people sending us messages and apps and so on.” The result, he says, is that we actually get worse at regulating our behavior for our own long-term benefit. “We’ve built an environment that ties into this short-term primitive thinking, and it tends to exclude the rational, long-term vision of the human capacity to plan, which is, of course, our great attribute.”

The way technology exploits our preference for short-term payoff doesn’t merely increase our propensity to scroll through pictures of our exes on Facebook or check our retweets every five minutes. For Whybrow, it’s at work in large-scale crises as well. “We’ve created all sorts of opportunities for people to benefit in the short term and to forget the long term,” he says. “That’s what happened in the 2008 financial crisis. That’s also what happens when you get sent a credit card, which you don’t have to pay off for six months.”

We already know, of course, that being in nature can be restorative and that humans are sometimes shortsighted. These are hardly radical thoughts in and of themselves. But viewing these issues through the lens of our evolution gives us a whole new way of thinking about our needs. It causes us to think about how other aspects of life in the urban, networked, information-affluent environment are holding us back.

Applying evolutionary theory to human culture and behavior was off limits until the late 20th century. That was for good reason because, as evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson explains, “when it was on limits it led to things like social Darwinism and eugenics.” We have a track record of abusing ideas like this.

 There are also those who are wary of mismatch, like Marlene Zuk, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Minnesota, who worry that the theory idealizes an earlier way of life. “It obviously makes sense that we didn’t evolve to sit on the couch and live on Diet Coke and Cheetos,” she says, “but it doesn’t necessarily follow from that [theory] that what we should be doing is living exactly as our ancestors lived.” The barefoot running craze is one example. Sure, our hunter-gatherer ancestors may have ran without shoes, but that doesn’t mean that’s the best way for us to run, skeptics like Zuk are apt to point out. The kind of running that is healthy for a person depends not only on their genes, but also on their development. If you grew up wearing shoes, then your foot and your gait are accustomed to them. You can’t make an easy switch to running barefoot and expect to thrive.

Connecting a health problem to mismatch is also made more complicated by the fact that we often don’t fully understand the underlying mechanisms at work. “You have to be cautious with this,” says Louv, “because a lot of this evidence that has emerged quite recently is correlative rather than causative evidence.” In the case of ADHD, it is hypothesized that involuntary attention restores directed attention, which explains the cognitive benefits of being outdoors. It’s plausible, but it’s not proven.

 But incorporating an evolutionary perspective—remembering that we are, in fact, animals that adapted to live in a different environment—can be the key to answering important questions. “If you don’t have the idea of mismatch in mind,” says Wilson, “then you’re going to muddle all sorts of things.” Atherosclerosis, the leading cause of cardiovascular disease in modern humans, is one example. In trying to identify what causes the fatty buildup characteristic of the condition, researchers are awash in data. But it turns out atherosclerosis is all but nonexistent in people living on a paleo diet. The evolutionary perspective—understanding how our current diet differs from what we adapted to as hunter-gatherers—gives medical researchers a framework for understanding which foods contribute to the disease and which do not. It would scarcely occur to you to even make the distinction between an agricultural diet and a pre-agricultural diet if you weren’t thinking about what our ancestors evolved to eat.

Another example of how mismatch theory can shed light on the current plight of human beings is morning sickness. When we imagine ourselves to be separate from our animal ancestors and their evolved needs, we think of the nausea of morning sickness as a problem to be solved. And so we develop drugs to alleviate its symptoms so that expecting mothers can eat what they want. But from an evolutionary perspective, morning sickness is an adaptive response that causes the mother to eat on behalf of her fetus rather than on behalf of herself. It helps the mother filter out things that are toxic to a fetus during the first trimester when it is at its most vulnerable.

As the 21st century progresses, and urbanization continues, and ever more immersive and distracting technologies gain control over our lives, it will become more difficult to ignore the incredible explanatory power of mismatch theory.

Whybrow imagines a cultural shift in which we learn to reconnect with our more animal roots and, to borrow Henry David Thoreau’s phrase from Walden, “to live deliberately.”

It may be awhile before the idea of evolutionary mismatch is part of the public conversation, and even longer before it's used to guide public health. The science is still young; our understanding of our own health—both physical and psychological—is still incomplete. And, even as we gain more understanding, our environment will continue to shift. As it does, we may want to make a point of regularly asking ourselves, in what ways are we like the sea turtles heading toward the glow of the coastal road, and how can we point ourselves back to the brightest part of the ocean's horizon?

Einstein’s Camera 
How one renegade photographer is hacking the concept of time.
Joshua Hammer in Matter
ADAM MAGYAR IS A computer geek, a college dropout, a self-taught photographer, a high-tech Rube Goldberg, a world traveler, and a conceptual artist of growing global acclaim. But nobody had ever suggested that he might also be a terrorist until the morning that he descended into the Union Square subway station in New York.

At the time, Magyar was immersed in a long-running techno-art project called Stainless, creating high-resolution images of speeding subway trains and their passengers, using sophisticated software he created and hardware that he retrofitted himself. The scanning technique he developed—combining thousands of pixel-wide slices into a single image—allows him to catch passengers unawares as they hurtle through dark subway tunnels, fixing them in haunting images filled with detail no ordinary camera can capture.

Magyar set up his standard array of devices—camera, scanner, voltage meters, blue and black cables, battery pack, tripod, laptop—and waited for a train to roll into the station. He hadn’t anticipated the vigilance of post-9/11 New Yorkers, several of whom complained to the police about the longhaired man wielding what looked like a jerry-built piece of surveillance equipment. It didn’t take long before a transit cop approached him.

“What are you doing?” he asked.

“I’m scanning trains,” Magyar said.

The policeman led Magyar to a room in the bowels of Union Square, then summoned a pair of plainclothes officers to interrogate him. They inspected his equipment, pored through his digital files. “Tell us who you’re working for,” they said.

Once Magyar convinced them that he was not scrutinizing the subway for nefarious purposes, that he was an artist (his website, featuring examples of his work, helped), the police settled on a $25 fine for violating a regulation against using a tripod on the platform, and sent him on his way.


From the series “Stainless,” New York, 2010. The original prints are over eight feet.
IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME that Adam Magyar has had to explain his work to mystified observers. Born in Hungary in 1972, Magyar began taking pictures in his late twenties, roaming the streets of Asian cities and capturing images of Indian street vendors, Hindu holy men, and Himalayan students. His work evolved rapidly from conventional documentary photography to surreal, radically experimental imagery that reflects his obsession with finding innovative new uses for digital technology. A self-taught engineer and software designer who assembled his first computer while in his teens, Magyar captures his images using some of the world’s most sophisticated photographic equipment, modified with software he writes himself. Additional code, also of his own design, removes nearly all distortion, or “noise,” from his data, producing images of remarkable clarity.

In a growing body of photographic and video art done over the past decade, Magyar bends conventional representations of time and space, stretching milliseconds into minutes, freezing moments with a resolution that the naked eye could never have perceived. His art evokes such variegated sources as Albert Einstein, Zen Buddhism, even the 1960s TV series The Twilight Zone. The images—sleek silver subway cars, solemn commuters lost in private worlds—are beautiful and elegant, but also produce feelings of disquiet. “These moments I capture are meaningless, there is no story in them, and if you can catch the core, the essence of being, you capture probably everything,” Magyar says in one of the many cryptic comments about his work that reflect both their hypnotic appeal and their elusiveness. There is a sense of stepping into a different dimension, of inhabiting a space between stillness and movement, a time-warp world where the rules of physics don’t apply.

“I grew up in my father’s workshop. I learned to work with tools, I developed a general understanding of materials. And I learned how to combine things.”
Magyar’s work represents a fruitful cross-fertilization of technology and art, two disciplines—one objective and mathematical, the other entirely subjective—that weren’t always regarded as harmonious or compatible. Yet the two are intertwined, and breakthroughs in technology have often made new forms of art possible. Five thousand years ago, Egyptian technicians heated desert sand, limestone, potash, and copper carbonate in kilns to make a synthetic pigment known as “Egyptian blue,” which contributed to the highly realistic yet stylized portraiture of the Second and Third Dynasties.

By the fifteenth century, paint based on transparent walnut and linseed oil began to replace opaque egg-based tempera, infusing art with a new luminosity and naturalism that paved the way for Renaissance masters like Jan Van Eyck, Tintoretto, and Caravaggio. Nineteenth-century experiments with light-sensitive materials capable of capturing and stabilizing an image—beginning with Louis Daguerre’s silver-plated sheets of copper fumed with iodine vapor—led to the invention of photography. In the 1950s, rapid improvements in emulsions and film speed allowed movie directors to take their craft outdoors and shoot in minimal light—propelling the naturalistic New Wave cinema of Jean-Luc Godard and other innovators.

Digital photography, first developed in the 1970s, gave rise to two types of image-capturing devices: standard digital cameras and scanners. The former captures an entire subject in a single exposure. The latter, by contrast, captures an image in a sequence. The sensor moves over the subject—a printed document, for example—and photographs it line by line, then assembles a composite image. Scanners, graphics-editing programs, and high-speed industrial video cameras have allowed conceptual artists to break the bounds of conventional photography and become increasingly abstract and surreal.

Doris Mitsch, based in Northern California, scans flora, sea creatures, and other natural objects into an old G4 Mac, then tweaks them in Photoshop to create stunningly lucid compositions unobtainable by even the highest-speed cameras. Penelope Umbrico assembles images found online into vast collages. Her 541,795 Suns (from Sunsets) from Flickr, created in 2006, reflects her fascination with the Internet and the ways in which it has subsumed other realities. And the Latvia-born photographer Misha Gordin creates nightmarish, black-and-white composite images, such as his acclaimed “Crowd” series, that conjure up the oppression of totalitarian systems. “In conceptual photography . . . the idea or vision is transformed by the camera to an image connected to reality only by my imagination,” Gordin once wrote. “The initial process is similar to writing poetry. From there it becomes more technical.” Magyar, an admirer of Gordin’s work, also creates black-and-white photographs and video images permeated with a similar brooding quality, though his human beings are bound not by political systems, but by the limits of perception.


I FIRST MET MAGYAR at his tidy one-bedroom apartment in Friedrichshain, a gentrifying neighborhood in the former East Berlin. He has long, dark hair, a thin beard and mustache, and dark, brooding eyes; he looks like a Renaissance portrait of a Slavic saint, or an aging rocker from one of Berlin’s last surviving squatter apartment buildings.

Magyar has lived in Berlin since January 2008, yet has had few gallery exhibitions there and doesn’t mingle with local artists. “The galleries are a bit punk, and my stuff is an engineer kind of thing,” he told me, brewing espresso in the kitchen, while his girlfriend, Zazi Porcsalmy, a Hungarian translator whom he has known since high school, served Christmas cookies in the living room. Although he has lived in Berlin for six years, Magyar barely speaks German, a reflection of both his immersion in other disciplines—“I spent the time here learning two computer languages, I didn’t have time for anything else,” he explains—and the detached-observer quality that permeates his work. Like the subway passengers he pins down in his Stainless series, I’ve managed to pin down Magyar during a momentary pause in a life of constant motion: He’s permanently passing through.

Magyar was born and raised in the Hungarian city of Debrecen, a regional center of 200,000 just west of the Romanian border. His mother was a dentist, his father an architect and interior designer who created bars and restaurants for a state-owned company during the Communist era. The elder Magyar moonlighted as an artist, making fanciful light fixtures and other household objects out of copper in a workshop beside his home. “I grew up in my father’s workshop,” Magyar remembers. “I learned to work with tools, I developed a general understanding of materials. And I learned how to combine things.” Magyar’s parents sent him to an elementary school that specialized in music, and he sang with Hungary’s most prestigious youth choir, performing in Finland and Greece when most travel to the West was banned. He attended an advanced technological high school, but he found the curriculum too theoretical and rebelled against the discipline. “I was the only one in the class who didn’t have to wear a uniform. I was never easily controllable,” he says. Magyar dropped out of college, taught himself computer code, built rudimentary computers, and supported himself doing graphic design on a freelance basis and, for two years, running a one-man business that printed corporate logos on pencils and cigarette lighters. “It was horrible, but it was money,” he told me.

By this point the Berlin Wall had fallen, the Eastern Bloc had dissolved, and Magyar could indulge a growing wanderlust. “I always wanted to travel, ever since I remembered. I was about four when I was dreaming about leaving for the world,” he recalls. “My father once told me that there used to be people whose profession was ‘traveler,’ and I took it literally. I liked the idea of living from a suitcase, going from place to place. I think it stuck in my brain. When I received my first salary, I just left. I think I am a permanent traveler in a way.” He backpacked through Morocco and, at 27, visited India for the first time. “It was the most difficult place I had ever been,” he says. “The colors, the smells—it’s heavy to digest. It became a kind of icon, and I started going back every year.”

Magyar’s life of travel honed his skills as an observer and reinforced his sense of being an outsider. At one level he seemed in constant motion. At another level he was capable of remaining still for long periods simply watching the flow of life. He once spent six months studying the movement of the river in Varanasi, the ancient Hindu capital on the Ganges. During that trip, he asked Zazi to bring him a book on introductory photography that he had won as a prize years before in elementary school. “I was almost 30,” he said. “And I started learning about apertures and light and developing my stuff in a darkroom. I loved it.” A year later, he documented daily life at a private school in Darjeeling, a Himalayan hill station in northeastern India, and his series of black-and-white photos won first prize in the annual Hungarian Press Photography competition. “He never worked too fast,” Zazi remembers. “If he found a person or a place intriguing he’d stand around for hours.”

But Magyar quickly found that straightforward documentary photography bored him. He set up a camera inside a movie theater in Varanasi, and shot one-minute exposures of the audience in near-total darkness. He shot images of passengers seated in the rear of taxis in Calcutta, and individuals framed inside doctors’ waiting rooms and in an elevator in Shanghai. Hannah Frieser, the former director of Light Work, an artist-run cooperative that organized an ambitious exhibition of Magyar’s work, Kontinuum, in three U.S. museums in 2013—Light Work in Syracuse, the Houston Center for Photography, and the Griffin Museum of Photography outside Boston—says that “the elevator series is pivotal to understanding him. It reflects this idea of taking your camera and making it the stationary part and photographing individuals over and over again. He doesn’t look at people in a judgmental way. He avoids asking a lot of questions. Instead it is just this experience of observing and being present, and defining life through this flow.” The work also reflected Magyar’s growing interest in the limitations of the human sensory perception, compared to what was possible with certain new and old technologies, and prefigured his efforts to push the boundaries of what we can see and experience. “I wanted to surround people in a cage, in a way. I was thinking about how little choice we have when we select our path,” he told me. “We are able to see just a narrow angle, whatever we do. Our knowledge is really limited, and small.”


Optronis high-speed camera equipped with custom parts for the “Stainless” videos and a modified battery pack.
MAGYAR BEGAN EXPERIMENTING with scanning in 2003. “I wanted to get out of conventional photography,” he told me. “I remember I didn’t sleep too much. I was up whole nights, thinking about how to do it.” In an early experiment, Magyar built his own primitive scanner, using an East German slide projector that cast a narrow light beam. Then he constructed a platform out of a stack of Lego bricks that permitted the beam to “scan” across a subject by slowly tilting from top to bottom. A standard reflex camera captured all of the scanned lines in a single shot, re-assembling them into one image during a minute-long exposure. In effect, the scanner was slicing a minute of time into thin sections, and the camera was stacking the slices back together, creating a single image composed of all those moments. Magyar took to scanning himself, experimenting with different physical movements that created distorted final images. “When you turned around, the image that came out showed your body as a corkscrew,” he says. “It was an interesting technological experiment, but that was it. I put it away for years.”

He remained fascinated, however, by the notion of capturing different parts of a person or of people at different times, constructing a still image out of “little pieces,” he says. This matched his growing interest in what he calls “the ever-changing nature of the present,” the constant flow of life that defied easy visual representation.

In 2006, during a months-long stay in Shanghai, he had an epiphany. “I had this feeling that I would, like, scan the flow of people. I began looking for the right kind of spaces where I could find a monotonous flow.” Magyar first studied escalators in Shanghai shopping malls. Then his gaze shifted to city streets—particularly major intersections or bus stops with a continuous procession of humanity. Once he had the concept in his head, he set about to develop the technology to realize it. “It was continuous research,” he says. “It took me a few weeks to figure it out.”

The answer, Magyar realized, was a modified version of the “slit scan” camera, the type used to determine photo finishes at racetracks and at Olympic sporting events by capturing a time sequence in one image. Such cameras were rare and cost many thousands of dollars, so Magyar set out to build one himself. He joined a medium-format camera lens to another sensor and wrote his own software for the new device. Total cost: $50. He inverted the traditional scanning method, where the sensor moves across a stationary object. This time, the sensor would remain still while the scanned objects were in motion, being photographed one consecutive pixel-wide strip at a time. (This is the basic principle of the photo-finish camera.) Magyar mounted the device on a tripod in a busy Shanghai neighborhood and scanned pedestrians as they passed in front of the sensor. He then digitally combined over 100,000 sequential strips into high-resolution photographs.


A close-up from “Urban Flow” (#424), shot in Hong Kong with a homemade version of a “slit-scan” camera.
The result was Urban Flow, a series of one-foot-high, eight-foot-long prints that captured a parade of humanity marching through time: Those at the far right had passed by the sensor approximately two minutes before those on the far left. “Each little fragment is the present, and all these present fractions come together to give you the story,” Magyar explains. “By the time we see the story, it’s like our memory. It’s already past.”

Eerie distortions of objects in motion and at rest reminded viewers that they were looking at a pictorial representation of time, not space. Speeding buses were compressed into Smart cars. Passing buses were elongated like Metroliners. Slower walkers had billowing pants legs, or feet like skis, or Oscar Pistorius–style blades. And because of the peculiar nature of the scanning technology, everyone was moving in the same direction. “The horizontal axis is not about space, it’s not about left and right, it’s about earlier and later,” he says. “If two people are crossing the pixel at the same moment, they will look like they are walking together.”

Urban Flow feels both comical and melancholy; like a time-bending, mind-bending vision of human destiny and mortality. The choice of black-and-white imagery came after long consideration. “I experimented with color, but people looked like colorful confetti, which was not my point,” says Magyar. “This is not a carnival, this is a little bit sad for me. We are all heading toward the same destination, which is sort of a death.”

Lars Torkuhl, a Shanghai-based design engineer, met Magyar in China, and visited his Shanghai apartment to see the new work in progress. “It was shocking to see the place,” Torkuhl recalls. “You had to carve your way past water bottles and other debris into the room to navigate to the desk.” After showing Torkuhl his jury-rigged prototype, Magyar displayed the first of the Urban Flow series on the computer screen. “I was blown away by the beauty, the crispness of the image,” says Torkuhl. “I said ‘Adam, this is extraordinary, are you going to show it?’ But he hadn’t even thought about it. . . . There was so much technology involved that he hadn’t dealt with before. He said, ‘this is nowhere near ready.’ I replied ‘What do you mean? It can be ready very soon.’”

Torkuhl introduced Magyar to a friend, the French artist Thomas Charvériat, who had just opened a gallery, Island6, in a renovated warehouse in the artist’s district of Shanghai. Magyar’s slit-scan photographs captivated Charvériat, too, and he offered to mount an exhibition. Magyar sold nearly every one of the dozen pieces he had on display—at modest prices of between $700 to $1,400—and received orders for several more. Magyar was amazed that his work had any commercial value at all: “I went back to Hungary, but I knew that I had to start building something from this.”

“In Zen you can train for five years before you shoot a bow and arrow. And that describes exactly what Adam does. Time doesn’t exist for him.”
HIS NEXT MAJOR PROJECT was Stainless, shot inside subway stations in major cities like Paris, Tokyo, and New York City. It was a quantum leap forward. He invested in a high-quality industrial camera and a “line scan” device designed to capture high-resolution images of circuit boards, bottle tops, or other fast-moving objects on assembly lines, exposing micro-cracks and other defects incapable of being perceived by standard cameras. The resulting line-scan camera uses a single row of light-sensitive sensors to constantly scan moving objects at high speed, eliminating most distortion.

Stainless consciously calls to mind the realm of theoretical physics, with its references to the thought experiments of Albert Einstein. Magyar’s stationary camera aimed at a moving train bears echoes of Einstein’s hypothesis that “distant simultaneity”—the idea that two spatially separated events occur at the same time—is not absolute, but depends on the observer’s frame of reference. In a famous thought experiment, Einstein imagined two observers—one standing inside a speeding train car, the other on a platform as the train moves past—who perceive the same flash of light at the exact moment that they cross paths. The passenger in the train sees the light strike the front and the back of the train car simultaneously; the stationary bystander sees it hit at different times. Similarly, Magyar warps time and reveals the subjectivity of human perception: His line-scan camera transforms a speeding blur into a frozen image of impossible clarity and stillness, a reality imperceptible to both passengers speeding into the station and bystanders waiting to board the train. The individuals in his trains ride together yet apart, lost in their own thoughts, often transfixed by their hand-held devices.




“You start paying attention to how these people interact with their technology, and how they barely interact with each other,” says Hannah Frieser, the former director of Light Work. Yet the eerie images can also be seen as a celebration of the human community, something that Magyar grew increasingly to appreciate as he traveled the world. The straphangers he captured in Paris, Shanghai, Hong Kong, New York, London, Tokyo, Paris, Rome, and Berlin manifest striking similarities in appearance, expression, and attitude that transcend cultural and geographical differences. In her catalog notes for the show, Frieser drew a clear distinction between the street photography practiced by masters such as Diane Arbus, Gary Winograd, and Henri Cartier-Bresson, and Magyar’s kind of image-making. “The life that he chronicles is made up of everyday people, not the most beautiful, eccentric, and destitute who typically draw the attention of photographers,” she wrote. “They looked for differences whereas Magyar ascertains similarities. They kept moving through the city, while Magyar remains stationary and waits for people to move past his camera … He jumps to different cities in various countries and continents until the commonalities within mankind begin to emerge.”

The Stainless photos also offered the most telling example of Magyar’s relentless perfectionism. (Pictured above, Stainless #7649 New York) Magyar desperately wanted to shoot in the tunnels of Tokyo—“the ultimate subway system, the ultimate urban environment” —but a subtle flicker in the lighting produced over-exposed and under-exposed frames that appeared on his images as vertical lines. Magyar’s solution: He rode the subways for a week with his light meter, taking readings at all 290 stations in the network. “I found five stations with high-frequency light, so I could start working there,” he recalls. “But inside the train the light was still bad, so I spent three months making the software to get rid of those lines.” Magyar also faced another problem after his tripod was banned from the New York City subway system. He was obliged to use a hand-held camera, which resulted in further distortions on his images; several weeks were taken up devising more code to eliminate them. Lars Torkuhl, the German design engineer, compares him to a Zen Buddhist master. “In Zen you can train for five years before you shoot a bow and arrow. And that describes exactly what he does,” Torkuhl told me. “Time doesn’t exist for him. He lives and executes his work in a crisp, detailed manner, exactly like his pictures.”

SHORTLY AFTER COMPLETING Stainless, Magyar began to consider transitioning to moving images. After months of research, he persuaded the German manufacturer Optronis to lend him one of its $16,000, high-performance industrial video cameras—used in crash tests and robotic-arm studies, and even for analyzing the hind hooves of show-jumping horses. With a high level of light sensitivity and advanced TimeBench analysis software, the Optronis shoots high-resolution images at astonishing speeds: up to 100,000 frames per second, compared to 24 frames per second in a traditional film camera.

Magyar turned the concept of Stainless on its head: Instead of standing on a platform shooting passengers speeding past him, Magyar now positioned himself inside the moving subway car, recording stationary commuters on the platform as train and camera rolled into the station. Again, the ghost of Einstein permeates these images, and again, he was warping time: Magyar shot the footage at 56 times normal speed, turning 12-second blurs into nearly 12-minute films of excruciating slowness. His commuters stand, together yet apart, with the studied, three-dimensional grace of statues—only the twitch of a lip or a finger drawn toward an iPhone indicating that these people were caught in hyper-slow motion, inhabiting an elongated moment. Magyar extracts drama from an infinitesimal flash of time. “I want to capture something that happens in milliseconds, something that you don’t even realize took place,” he told me. “I’m extending the moments—the present, the now—because as humans we live only in the past and the future. But the only existence we have is now, and that is something that we don’t even consider.”

The breathtaking clarity of the Stainless videos is also the result of the most challenging software code he has ever had to write. In his experiments with industrial cameras, Magyar found that the image quality was ideal for measuring speed, distance, and volume, but not entirely suitable for the demands of an artist. He wrote complex programs to improve the quality of images shot in conditions of low lighting and poor contrast. Another problem was image noise—columns, rows, lines, and other random distortions, a typical issue with high-sensitivity digital sensors. He spent nearly two years, on and off, developing noise-reduction software, solving one problem only to confront a new one. “The engineers don’t have to deal with this, but I do. I cannot sleep. I’m working on this for months, and I don’t stop. You find a new problem, and you have to find a solution.”

A COUPLE OF MORNINGS after our first encounter, I arrange to meet Magyar at Alexanderplatz, one of Berlin’s busiest subway stations, for a demonstration of the Stainless project. I arrive at the height of rush hour, and wait for ten minutes at one end of the crowded platform before he appears. His long hair spills over his black parka, which is matched by black work boots, black jeans, and a black daypack. Inside the pack, Magyar carries his customized Optronis video camera and a laptop. Four cables, blue and black, poke out of the bag. He says the bulky apparatus makes him feel like “the guy from Ghostbusters.” After his run-in with the police at Union Station, Magyar adapted his equipment so that he can conceal it inside a backpack, but to my eye the new setup seems likely to raise even more suspicions.

Six aboveground lines (S Bahn) and three underground lines (U Bahn) converge at Alexanderplatz, creating a constant flow of traffic throughout the morning. “I am looking for a situation where there is no gap, the more people the better,” he tells me. “There are only a couple of spots in every city that can provide that sort of crowd, and this is one of them.”

Magyar and I hop on the U2 and travel one stop to Rosa Luxemburg Platz, then cross the platform and catch the next train heading back to Alexanderplatz. In the crowded car Magyar fishes the apparatus out of his backpack. The gray aluminum camera body, adapted with viewfinder, hand grip, and cables that connect the device to his laptop and battery back, looks like a prototype cobbled together in a backyard garage. Red and green lights blink as he aims the lens through the window “I’m always getting asked, ‘Did you make this yourself?’” he tells me, as commuters gape in curiosity. Minutes later, we rumble into the station, and Magyar begins taping. It is all over in twelve seconds.

We stand and wait four minutes while the eight gigabytes of new data download to his laptop. (During his road trips he typically carries two hard drives that together can store three terabytes.) Magyar studies the procession of beautifully lit faces that he has extracted from the twelve-second blur, and pronounces himself satisfied. He shoots hundreds of hours of video to obtain the results he wants; one of his favorites in the series, shot in 2011 at Alexanderplatz (see video), serendipitously captures, in the background, two little girls loping along the platform. Their graceful movements contrast with the stillness of the commuters in the foreground—a jolting reminder that that the image one is witnessing is not a photo, but a stretched-out moment—what Magyar calls “in-between time.” “Those girls were a real gift to me,” he says.

“His work says that we are alive and that the world is even more of a living place than we are aware of.”

From the series “Squares” Hong Kong V 2007-2008. Magyar took multiple overhead shots of individuals, then combined them into vast artifical public spaces.
Of all the many disciplines involved in his work, marketing has not come easily to Magyar. He fell into the art world haphazardly, and in the early part of his career he was mystified about how the business worked. “It’s not really nice to live with the naiveté of a 20-year-old when you are 35,” he admitted a couple of days later, as we drove across Berlin on a rainy night to his custom frame shop in the posh neighborhood of Savigny Platz. Magyar was preparing to ship several prints of Urban Flow to an art show in Miami Beach. “I started this in the worst time—2008, 2009—when the art market had collapsed” he says. Five years have passed since then, and Magyar is now fetching considerably higher prices for his work—up to $14,000 per print of Stainless—but he is still uncomfortable with the networking and self-promotion that goes with the territory. “His commercial instincts suck,” says Lars Torkuhl.

Still, Magyar has been learning. He has become a more poised and self-confident public speaker, seamlessly weaving together the conceptual and the technological aspects of his work. This year, for the first time, he was able to make a living just from art sales. There have been gallery openings from Harvard University to Budapest. In February, his work will be exhibited as part of three-artist show on urban life at the prestigious Julie Saul Gallery in Manhattan. The exhibition will include a Stainless video and several prints from his playful Squares series, done between 2006 and 2009: high-resolution photographs of hundreds of individuals shot from pedestrian overpasses and bridges, then Photoshopped together to create imaginary public plazas as seen from high above. “I have nothing to complain about,” Magyar says.

Magyar is planning a future gallery installation in which he will project several videos on huge screens that surround the spectators, and accompany the visuals with ominous sound effects—the drawn-out squeaking of brakes, the ambient noise of the subway station. “Sometimes people tell me that when they look at the videos, they think about death. It’s a bit like leaving your body,” he says.

Andrew Zolli is the Executive Director of Pop Tech, an organization that brings together innovators in the arts and sciences. After encountering Magyar’s work, he invited the artist to speak at Pop Tech’s most recent conference in Camden, Maine. He takes a different view of the work. “His work says that we are alive,” Zolli insists, “and that the world is even more of a living place than we are aware of.”

Either way, life or death, Magyar relishes the entire range of reactions: “What could be better for an artist than that? This is an amazing feeling, when you can do something that others think about. And when it happens, I’m really happy.”

*** Why You Should Stop Hacking Your Life and Invest in The Journey
richrollrichroll in General Writing: Idea, Thinking, Opinion
“Maybe stop trying so hard to find shortcuts to “hack” your life. The best things are hard. Invest in the journey. Just sayin’.”

A lark of a tweet I fired off last December that — somewhat to my surprise — went semi-viral, shared across a variety of social networks and blogs like wildfire.

Why is this surprising? And what does it say?

I was surprised because we live in such a meme, hashtag and shortcut obsessed culture. And what is the trending topic of the day? The meme that is beyond reproach, enjoying platinum status and irresistible staying power in every corner of the Internet?

The hack.

#lifehack #lifehacker #biohack #fitnesshack #diethack #fithack #weightlosshack — and on and on, blah, blah, blah.

Go ahead and Google any derivation of the term and see what comes up. It’s amazing, actually. There are even entire health, fitness, lifestyle and technology conferences built around the idea.

Consistent with our shrinking attention span, demand for immediate gratification, intolerance for hard work, rebuttal of experiential value, and general (illusory) sense of entitlement to the good life, this hack ethos is emblematic of our obsessive modern imperative for immediacy — the drive to turbocharge, accelerate, optimize, scramble, quicken and hasten our way to maximum health, fitness, professional success and ultimately happiness. A hell-bent zeal to quick-fix ourselves to overnight six-pack abs, envious wealth, limitless free time, and in some ways I suppose, salvation. Finger-snap your way to nirvana. Don’t just keep up with The Jones’ — blow them out of the water!

Of course, in many ways this is nothing new — old as time actually. The hack a mere modern vernacular reframing of practices and marketing techniques dating back to the snake oil salesmen and carnival barkers of yore, promising everything from miracle cures to deliverance with a sharp preacher’s tongue and unconscious reflexive response that suppresses question and finds us impulsively forking over our hard-earned coin to the prophet of the moment.

But the acute nature of this modern rush is also something qualitatively new. And disturbing.

It used to be an insult to call someone a hack. Now it’s high praise. How did a term so historically pejorative suddenly become aspirational?

To figure this out, let’s take a step back.

KnowYourMeme defines “life hacks” as “tricks, skills or shortcuts that are meant to increase a person’s productivity or efficiency in their everyday lives.”

The term was originally coined by tech journalist Danny O’Brien in 2003, but it seems the idea really took off with the publication of Tim Ferriss’ wildly popular 4-Hour Workweek — a New York Times’ bestselling primer on how to cut inefficiencies out of your waking hours, streamline your day and ultimately “hack” your way to professional and personal happiness. Tim followed up with two companion chart busters — 4-Hour Body and 4-Hour Chef — both highly entertaining and instructional roadmaps on shortcutting proficiency of a panoply of fitness and lifestyle skills on a fraction of the traditional time and energy commitment required for mastery. 80% of the results in 20% of the time.

Yahtzee! A movement was born. The rest is history.

And I have a big problem with this.

Okay Tim Ferriss fanboys, calm yourselves before you attack me. I actually love Tim’s books. And have nothing but mad respect for everything Tim is about — an idea-generating energizer bunny of a forward-thinking innovator tirelessly upending tradition and plumbing the deep crevasse for creative, new modalities and approaches to do more and live better. That is pure awesome. I too count myself as a fan. As I explain at length in Finding Ultra, I experimented with and relied upon many of the tools shared in 4HWW to reconfigure my life so that I could properly prepare for my performances at The Ultraman World Championships. They work. And my life is better as a result of reading that book. I am also forever grateful to Tim for allowing me to guest blog on his site on the day my book was released. He didn’t have to do that. But he did, and I will never forget the favor. But I digress…

In truth, a properly implemented hack is nothing more than leveraging a good idea (I guess #idea or #goodidea don’t really trend well when it comes to the meme-o-sphere). A way to cut wasted time so that you can invest yourself more fully in what makes your heart truly beat — a passion and pursuit that can transform your life by catalyzing a new journey.

I take no issue with this. It’s great, actually. And I think this is what Tim was actually trying to say.

But somewhere along the line I think even Tim would agree that we lost the thread. Somewhere along the line the hack has become the destination, rather than the tool. An end in and of itself. Kind of like becoming obsessed with a table saw rather than the process of using it to learn how to make a beautiful piece of furniture.

Moreover, the explosion of hack culture seems to inherently disrespect the paramount value of the journey — the true value in any experience — by supplanting it with an expedited rush to access to a result. And result is empty without grappling with the resistance that inevitably defines the battle.

Let’s assume for a moment that there really is a way to circumvent the time-tested notions of hard work, patience, dedication and passion to achieve prosperity, success, health and true satisfaction in life. Spoiler alert: there isn’t. But okay, let’s assume…

Would I take that path? Should you?

With resounding conviction, I say no.

How dare you — that’s just plain anti-American!

Is it? The entire ideal of the American Dream (which is problematic in its own right and basically an illusion, but that’s the subject of another blog post) was founded upon the aforementioned principles. Anything is possible if you work hard. It’s inherent in the very value system of manifest destiny. It’s what makes America, well, America.

Yet to contravene and devalue the meme of the moment by suggesting the admittedly unsexy notion that hard work, patience & the paramount value of experience over short cuts and quick fixes — in many ways the “anti-hack” — isn’t just iconoclastic, it’s anathema. Our principles have become inverted. A myopia eroding the core value system and the essence of what gives our lives meaning.

If you want to achieve the minimum aptitude threshold in a discipline so that you can tell others you did something, hack away. Implement the short cut, rush to accomplish the task and check the box. Bucket list item #54 done. Moving on to the next hack.

Now ask yourself: how did that experience make me feel?

If you’re like me, probably not much of anything.

Now let’s examine what happens when you try to be the very best you can be at something you are inherently passionate about. Suddenly the heart beats faster. The palms begin to sweat. Maybe it’s excitement. But more likely it’s fear. That’s right, fear. Commitment — total dedication to the core — is about as scary as it gets. It’s not just hard. It’s without a doubt the most difficult thing imaginable. Because if you take that risk, truly put yourself completely on the line and fail (or succeed — yes fear of success plagues more than you might imagine), then you will have to reckon with yourself. Terrifying!

But that is the whole point and purpose. Failure (or success) — or at least the prospect of failure (or success) — is what gives the journey proper context, rich consistency, and towering emotional, physical, financial and spiritual stakes that fertilize the soul for quantum growth irrespective of outcome. And growth is everything. But it can only result from earnest investment in experience. So fear and commitment aren’t things to be avoided, but rather embraced with a bear hug of everything.

This is to say that the inherent value of any given experience is directly proportional to the extent to which you are physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually invested in it. Using a hack to short cut the journey only robs you of the rich texture presented by the opportunity. In a word, it’s the difference between winning the lottery and earning that ransom by weathering the blood, sweat and tears that come with total fidelity.

So it’s the experience you should be seeking, not the short cut. It’s the voyage you should embrace, not the destination. It’s the path that elevates the soul, not the destination. It’s the process that ennobles, not the result.

If you’re with me so far, then congratulations. I submit that you are on the right track.

A track that has no tolerance for hacks.

On a personal level, I could have competed at the Ultraman World Championships on 20% of the training I put in and still finished the race. But I didn’t. Instead, I put everything I had into those races because I had a yearning to answer a question for myself — what am I truly capable of? That query and yearning that could only be answered to my satisfaction by eliminating shortcuts and investing completely.

I could have banged out my book in 20% of the time it took to write it and likely it would have still found it’s way onto the Kindle. But I couldn’t say that I did everything possible to tell the story I wanted to tell to the best of my abilities.

I could be out having dinner with friends right now rather than pulling my hair out trying to figure out how to make sense of these ideas swimming around in my head. After all, I’m not getting paid for this. I had dental surgery today and should be in bed right now. Nobody asked me to write these ideas down. Quite possibly (likely?) you might all dislike the offering altogether. And ultimately writing is hard. Really hard. Much harder than riding my bike. I already tweeted the notion, so it would be easy to rationalize watching House of Cards instead. But I would be repressing who I am. Denying my passion to express myself. Saying no to experience.

And that is simply unacceptable.

Today I enjoy tremendous satisfaction knowing that on a daily basis I strive to invest absolutely everything I have in what makes my heart beat hardest. Looking back, it seems to all make perfect sense how events unfolded to take me from where I was to where I am today. But in the midst of it all, it was generally a chaotic, terrifying madness often teetering on disaster and punctuated by countless lows and gut-wrenching come-to-Jesus moments — I risked everything to the journey on a level beyond any relationship to rationality or acceptable norms of sanity.

And yet I rarely think about destinations. What it was like when I crossed a finish line. What I was feeling the day my book finally hit shelves. What I was doing the day I finally was able to hang up the suit and stop practicing law for a living. Or where I was when my little podcast project surpassed a million downloads. But not a day goes by that I don’t feel tremendous gratitude for the process endured to arrive at those seminal moments in my life. The unbearable pain of that 40-mile training run. The countless all nighters spent writing my book at the 24-hour Kinko’s sitting next to the homeless guy using a desk as a bed (I had no office at the time and for whatever reason I can’t seem to write well at home, but again I digress). It’s the vividness of those memories that give me a profound sense of fulfillment and gratitude. A sense of trudging a path of deep personal meaning. Simply put, you just can’t put a dollar value on that. As trite as it may sound, it truly is priceless.

Don’t misunderstand. I like goals and I like achieving them. They keep me focused and act as powerful drivers that lend structure to my day. But it’s crucial to emotionally detach from the end result or third-party reception to your efforts. Let it go. It’s none of your business. It’s also irrelevant. But what is relevant is signing up for the journey. What is crucial is showing up at the starting line. What is essential is taking that first step, followed by a second, on what I can only hope will be a pilgrimage that will last the remainder of your days in this short life. Irrespective of success or failure (subjective terms anyway), you are guaranteed to experience what it is like to be fully invested in something, anything. This is what it is to be completely alive. And that is the gift.

Just the other day I published my podcast interview with filmmaker Casey Neistat. I am a big fan of Casey’s work — in my opinion one of the most interesting, unique and culturally relevant populist filmmakers working today. But I’m an even bigger fan of his ethos and perspective. A life premised on embracing adventure, for Casey it’s all about the journey. Not to the manor born, Casey raised himself out of his trailer home welfare plight to where he is today by tackling incomprehensible odds head-on; by relentlessly investing in himself and doubling down on his passion; by embracing the hard road; by circumventing the gatekeepers and refusing to wait for permission; and by making countless bold, fearless choices.

Near the end of our conversation, Casey said something really compelling that catalyzed my desire to write this post. His roadmap for those who ask how he has built the creative, fulfilling life he currently enjoys. A recipe for success he guarantees to work:

All you have to do is commit your entire life to something, which will result in one of two outcomes. Either you will succeed, or you will die trying, which is in and of itself it’s own form of success.

This people, is the very essence of the anti-hack.

No shortcuts. Just a good, solid Malcolm Gladwell-esque 10,000+ hours of downright busting your ass on something that means everything to you. Toiling in obscurity. Failing relentlessly. Picking yourself up off the floor when all is lost and going the extra mile when nobody is looking. Slow, incremental progress. Tiny hard fought victories along the way that begin to take form. And ultimately congeal to lay the foundation for a life and legacy that has true value.

It’s sexy and easy to frame a narrative of the overnight success story — WhatsApp, Instagram, and American Idol are perfect examples of how the media can twist reality to multiply page views and amplify ratings. But take a peek behind the curtain on any so-called instantaneous triumph and you are certain to find an objective truth that doesn’t fit the neatly packaged narrative. Because every genuine, sustainable success is birthed only from incredible persistence, interminable patience, invisible defeats, rabid dedication and unrelenting passion.

Hacks are about a short cut to a destination. I don’t give a shit about destinations. But I care deeply about showing up and suiting up for the journey. And what I have learned about myself and others by embracing the pain, toil failure, tears, fear, mistakes that go hand in hand with the hard road less travelled is what gives everything meaning, context and value. A deep gratitude for a life lived well — to the fullest, and without compromise.

There is nothing sexy or meme-worthy about the journey. It’s hard. It’s painful. It’s not glossy and doesn’t lend itself to a hashtag or a glib tweet. It will never trend on Twitter.

This is not news. Deep down we all know it to be true. It’s why my tweet struck a chord despite being at odds with the savory meme-o-licious flavor of the month.

So if you have a passion and aspire to greatness — if you want to see what you are truly made of, or just how far you can go and what you are truly capable of — forget the hack. Commit to the daily pressure that compels infinitesimal progress over time. Wake up before dawn and apply yourself in silent anonymity. Practice your craft — in whatever shape or form that may be — late into the evening with relentless rigor. Embrace the fear. Let go of perfection. Allow yourself to fail. Welcome the obstacles. Forget the results. Give yourself over to your passion with every fiber of who you are. And live out the rest of your days trying to do better.

I can’t promise that you will succeed in the way our culture inappropriately defines the term. But I can absolutely guarantee that you will become deeply acquainted with who you truly are. You will touch and exude passion. And discover what it means to be truly alive.

In my opinion, this is the legit definition of success. And the essence of greatness.

Because the seat of genuine value, beauty and satisfaction lies in the experience of getting there. That’s the truth.

A promise no hack can give you. Not now, not ever.

* Sunil 2014 Feb 27
It’ll be great if you can focus on what they can learn (soft skills wise) from ALX experience to be able to do better in GCR.
1.      During interactions with you over the last year, what were their greatest accomplishments and what strengths did you observe?

Sunil has great analytical skills that enable him to get to the core of complex technical issues. He is also a prolific coder who can read and write c++ code very efficiently. Thanks to his commitment, STARC benchmark has achieved results beyond our original expectations. We have achieved factors of speed up and area compaction both beating the customer's target. We also reached 0 DRC/LVS quality as well as fix many layout quality issues. Later Sunil also helped re-architect and implement a stand-alone alx executable with significant advantages over titan-alx. 

2.      Is there anything that they could do to be even more effective in the role?

Given how effective Sunil is, it is rather hard to get a lot more effective :-). 

Sunil has reached a level of seniority in software where he can help junior colleagues become more productive and effective. He can do this by helping communicate detailed expectations along with a few but effective handholding sessions. 

On layout automation, Sunil can expand his horizons by carefully examining the input layout from customers. He would need to generalize his findings to generic layouts, but also identify which patterns are of the most importance while at the same time handling rare corner cases gracefully.

3.      Add any other comments you would like me to be aware of.

It is a pleasure to work with Sunil. He always takes the time to do his homework, and provide valuable input at very high levels of technical complexity. He does not shy away from either short-term band-aiding to help projects move along, or open-ended long term challenges with high levels of uncertainty.

* Mohit 2014 Feb 27
It’ll be great if you can focus on what they can learn (soft skills wise) from ALX experience to be able to do better in GCR.
1.      During interactions with you over the last year, what were their greatest accomplishments and what strengths did you observe?

Mohit has ramped up very quickly in complex custom layout concepts and was able to deliver a novel solution to analog symmetry extraction and modeling. He is also an expert in OA data model which came in handy to help support Paths and Multi-part paths. Finally, Mohit was able to extend the manhattan model in ALX to handle 45-degree edges in paths and polygons. 

2.      Is there anything that they could do to be even more effective in the role?

Mohit is very effective in his role. I just recommend him to continue to contribute in a diverse set of areas in his current project. He will soon be an expert in layout automation and can contribute to any challenging project.

3.      Add any other comments you would like me to be aware of.

A very nice person and a pleasure to work with. I appreciate his soft spoken, but attentive nature. He listens very well and is a great addition to any team. 

* Rahul:
1.	During interactions with you over the last year, what were his greatest accomplishments and/or what strengths did you observe?

Rahul has a very good understanding of analog and custom digital layout, including LVS and DRC tools. He was able to test CAD tools on complex layout scenarios by manually creating layout test cases and running CAD tools including LVS and DRC.

2.	Is there anything that he could do to be even more effective in the role?

Rahul has recently started to write scripts to help automate layout creation/checking as well as automate run flows. He can take some courses on a relevant language (e.g., Tcl, Python or Ruby) to expand his skills on that front.

3.	Add any other comments you would like me to be aware of.

Rahul is very easy to communicate and work with (even though he and I have been about 10 hours apart around the world, and we have not met face to face yet!). He is a great team player and a reliable and hard working engineer.

Alarmi kurmak icin uc senaryo var:
1- Evden cikan son kisi sensen, <exit>'e basacaksin. Bastigin andan itibaren 
dis kapiyi kapatman icin 60 saniye veriyor sana. Garajin araba kapilari
alarma bagli degil. Alarma bagli olan kapilar (ve 60 saniyede kapaman
gerekenler) sunlar: 
 - Evden garaja cikis
 - Evden on bahceye cikis
 - Garajdan yan bahceye cikis
 - Evde alt kattan (basement) arka bahceye cikis

2- Evden cikan son kisi sen degilsen, <stay>'e basiyorsun. Ayni (1)deki gibi
60 saniye saymaya basliyor kapiyi kapatman icin.

3- Evdeyken alarmi calistirmak icin <stay>'e basiyorsun.


Her uc durumda da kapilardan her hangi birisi acilirsa alarm aktive
oluyor. 60 saniye icersinde <DORT-RAKAMLI-SIFRE> girerek susturmak
gerekiyor.

Birinci durumda evdeki hareket sensorleri aktive olursa alarm calmaya
basliyor. Hemen <DORT-RAKAMLI-SIFRE> girmek gerekiyor.
* felsefe
** last lecture
Thanks so much for making philosophy accessible to the lay person (with or without an identity over time :-)!

It is interesting to see that many of us want more of this (doing
philosophy) and at the same time care so much about "progress". Is there a
20paradox here?

The closing remarks by Dr. Hare finished with posing a good question on "progress," too. How do we know we are making, or could make progress in any given direction?
** incompatibilism
*** DISCUSSION QUESTION 14.4.3 (Anna & Beth vs. Determinism)
djrochford about 23 hours ago
DISCUSSION PROMPT
In Anna & Beth III, the things outside of Beth’s control that guarantee
that Beth will burn the letter (Eve and her machine) do not cause Beth to
burn the letter. 

But if determinism is true then the things that guarantee that we do evil
(the initial conditions and scientific laws of our world) also cause us to
do evil.

Does this provide us with grounds for saying that Beth is morally
responsible for burning the letter, but that we would not be morally
responsible for doing evil if determinism were true? 

Bulent:
If "determinism" is true, then all our actions are ruled by forces beyond our control. We would just be like robots, completely ruled by our programming.

In my experience, I am partially ruled by my programming, i.e., both my nature (DNA) and the nurturing I had (family, culture, etc.). 

But, I have some amount of free will (I admit :-), and I act on it, and therefore I can claim those actions to be mine.

Going back to Beth, we can use the argument from analogy (e.g., Bertrand Russell) and say she is responsible (that's what our society does these days), even though, it is possible that she is under full complete control of her nature+nurture. For me, I would resort to reasonable doubt and claim her innocent.

*** q
If 'Damien could not have made X happen' means that if Damien had wished for X to happen, then X would still not have happened, then premises P3 and P4 are not unambiguously true. Why? Suppose Damien never has wished for the laws or the initial conditions to be different. If Determinism is true, then the laws plus the initial conditions necessitate that Damien doesn't have this wish. So, were he to have wished that the laws or initial conditions be different, the laws or the initial conditions would have had to have been different.

If 'Damien could not have made X happen' means that an obstacle stood in the way of Damien making X happen, then premises P3 and P4 are not unambiguously true. Certainly, there was nothing physical --- like a beast, or a brick wall --- that stood in the way of Damien making the laws or initial conditions different. Maybe the laws plus the initial conditions themselves have stood in Damien's way? But that is to just assume the conclusion of the argument.

If 'Damien could not have made X happen' means that it made no sense for Damien to regard his making X happen as an option, then premises P3 and P4 are unambiguously true. Damien cannot sensibly aim to change the laws and the initial conditions.
*** question
Suppose that somebody, call her 'Baddy', does something bad to you. Suppose that you later learn that some things outside of Baddy's control, the initial conditions of our world and the laws of nature that govern our world, guaranteed that she would do this thing to you.

Would this make you think 'she could not have done otherwise', 'she is not to blame for what she did'? If not, where is Van Inwagen's argument going wrong?

** response:
Wonderful discussion here. Thanks BillPowers, sofonisba and neha88.

The human mind (inside our brains) is what it is thanks to
evolution. Hardware/software co-design before engineers though about the
concept! It is the super/survival machine. I call it the "selfish" mind (in
reference to the famous book the "selfish" gene.. 

But, what makes you or me truly alive (as opposed to mechanical/thinking
/deterministic --mindstorm-- robots) is something beyond thinking.  

Do you remember the last time you woke up early in a morning and felt just
wonderful, in bliss, and did not know why? Well, because you were beyond
thinking! Did not worry about the "survival" of your mind/body/genes. You
enjoyed Life. 

So, I suggest we move on from "thinking" not only to the next lecture, but
also to a realization that some machines think, some machines even evolved
to "feel" (your pet bird e.g., let alone your dog!), and have "emotions",
but we humans are more than all of that mental/emotional phenomena.. 
** nice definitions
“People will treat anything as a person. We name our cars, shout at tables
when we bump into them, give birthday gifts to our pets, call plants
‘thirsty’, cajole clouds to part, and pray to gods for forgiveness. We act
as though every encounter were a social one, as if the world were populated
with minds like our own, as though the universe itself were conscious. ‘We
find human faces in the moon, armies in the clouds; and by a natural
propensity, if not corrected by experience and reflection ascribe malice or
good-will to every thing, that hurts or pleases us’, David Hume wrote some
250 years ago. These seem the symptoms of a madman, and yet they describe
the mind of a healthy human. Wherever we go, we are not alone. 
*** Treating something not alive as if it’s alive is called animism. 
*** Treating something nonhuman as if it’s human is called anthropomorphism.
The two often go hand
in hand, as animism feeds into anthropomorphism; when we treat something as
alive, we treat it as alive like us, with our full catalogue of mental
states. ……….. 
** hidden premises
It seems that there are some hidden premises to these arguments (in the lecture, in Searle's paper, in the discussions above):

 - P1: Thought requires a thinker.
 - P2: Thought contains understanding.

Here are some alternatives:

 - P1*: Thought produced "the thinker" and identified it as self.
 - C1: Self is illusory.

If I read correctly, Hume asserted as such (in his writings elsewhere, not the required reading for class).

 - P2a*: Understanding and intelligence are orthogonal to thought.
 - P2b*: Thought, in general, can be defined as any formal computing function. This contains human thought (in the general sense that encompasses feelings and emotions..)
 - C2: Human existence has ...
** turing
compute a function: I -> O always the same O for same I
  now randomize!
** Seale
Premise: Formal programs do not have intentionality.
Premise: Machines like humans do.

Is understanding same as thinking?
I think understanding requires thinking, but it is more than thinking.
In the same sense as intelligence/creativity is beyond cleverness/production.
*** DISCUSSION QUESTION 9.5.1
What would you say to the grue-projector to persuade him that he is making a mistake? Do you think you might succeed in persuading him that he was making a mistake?

Depends on what time it is now! Are we about to experience the shift of the "Magic Time?" If so, we can design some controlled experiments and see the likelihood of induction working and not working depending on the time of the n-1 observations and the time of the nth observation.

I can then also explain the "consistency condition" I posted under Question 9.4.1... But, nothing beats experience when it comes to matters of fact. I would just let her experience the shift of the Magic Time.. 

But, if the Magic Time is in the past (like the Big Bang), or in the future (like the time Sun will die), there is no point trying to persuade her!

*** Discussion Question 9.4.1 (Is Grue a Non-Projectable Property?)
This seems like bad reasoning:
'All the baubles we have seen so far have been grue, so, probably, the last one is grue too.'
Why is it bad reasoning? In Goodman's terms: Why is grue a non-projectable property?

Grueness/bleenness of particulars is a projectible property as long as all of its samples (all observations of particulars) are restricted to one side of the magic time. 

More formally, let us use "past" to denote all time t such that t < Magic Time, and "future" to denote all time t such that t > Magic Time. 

We have a projectible property iff all of my sampling is restricted to be in the "past", or if they are all confined to the "future". E.g., I do n-1 observations and I can induce the property of the nth observation if all of the observations are done at t < Magic Time, or alternatively if the first n-1 observations are all done at t > Magic Time, then I can correctly infer the property of the nth observation a priori using induction. 

Let's call this necessary & sufficient condition the "consistency condition."

When the consistency condition is NOT met, we don't have a projectible property.

The reasoning is good for all experiments that honor the consistency condition. Otherwise, it is bad.
** DISCUSSION QUESTION 7.6.1
Can you live with the idea that there is very little you know? Do you find it troubling? Discuss.

I love the title: no absolute knowledge. Thanks krystyna59! I don't get bothered by the lack of it, either.

Russ, also, brings up some very interesting perspectives..

But, before we go on further, here is a challenge: why not be skeptical of the skeptical hypothesis itself?? Can we be absolutely sure that we know very little? Especially where it matters..

Along those lines, here is my suggestions. Let's attack the skeptical hypothesis (P1) by providing an alternative (P2) and let's look into it..

P1: We know very little (I don't even know that I have hands. Agreed).

P2: We know a lot.

So, what do I think we know? Here is a sample:
I know that I believe that I have hands..  We use "belief" in our analysis of knowledge. So, this is admissible, I hope!. You can look inside and see what you believe. That already gives you a lot of (self-)knowledge. Wonderful. Isn't it?

I know that I trust and live by my justified beliefs. 

I know that my perception is not reality, so, I question it.

I know that I suffer when my perception diverges from reality a bit too much. The suffering points back to "reality"

I know that there are in me many (potentially conflicting) drives (family, work, reading, playing, etc, etc..)

I know that I enjoy math (discovered or invented, it does not matter), I believe that it is very powerful, and it has already showed its own limitations (Google Godel's incompleteness/inconsistency theorems).

I know that I enjoy physics (even though it is hard to follow the nuances of string theory). It shows us the depths of the atom, the breadth of the universe, shows that nothing is as it seems, (and nothing itself is a mystery..).

I know that I have many false beliefs, and even worse, some of them are hidden from me, to be uncovered at some point in the future (to my chagrin) when some of the superstructure they support crumbles..

And on, and on, and on... Please add your own..

So, maybe it is not so accurate that "we know very little." Actually, knowing what we can truly know (the self!), and otherwise, what little we know, is itself a critical first step towards realizing the meaning of life (that's how I see it at least). 

In short, ancient Greeks put it very nicely: Know thyself!

** Cartesian arguments :-)
*** defeasible: I know that I do not know, so I do NOT claim to know. I start with defeasible...
*** known implicature knowledge is closed under known implicature (if I know that A, and I know that if A is B, then, I know that B.)
** Show that the conditions (i, ii and iii) are not sufficient for (a).
[Are they necessary?]
(a) S knows that P IFF
  (i) P is true, 
 (ii) S believes that P, and 
(iii) S is justified in believing that P.

Note 1: {(iii) AND NOT (ii)} is possible. There is at least one such S/P.
 I.e., It is possible that an S is justified to believe a P, where P is
 false.

Note 2: For any P, if 
- (iii) is true, AND
- P => Q AND
- For S, P => Q (S knows that P => Q)

Then, S is justified in believing that Q.

Show an example where (i, ii and iii) are TRUE, AND S knows P is FALSE..


When is S justified in believing that P?
Strong evidence is not enough..

(iv): Belief that P is not falsely infered (based on a false belief).
(v): Sensitivity: If it hadn't been the case that P, you wouldn't have
believed that P. (small vs big cab company, hit&run: Statistical evidence
is not sensitive to truth.. 995 small vs 5 big cabs (95.5%). Vs. witness is 0.5%
possibility of being wrong.. If witness might see a big cab, but statistics
always favors small..
Confidence based on statistics (the past) is NOT sensitive to truth!

If NOT P, NOT (ii). (Is it the case that I cannot be fooled in this case? A
movie director put Barn facades up on all the hills around!)
This is similar to "conditioning:" Conditioned to believe a false
belief.. Does not make belief (that P) true knowledge, even if it is true
(P is true) in this specific case. My belief is not true knowledge: I
believed many false instance of it in the past...

(vi): Accuracy: My beliefs on this matter are mostly accurate..
(vii): Based on a reliable method (can be repeated by others easily)

IFF CONDITIONS in words:
1) p is true (who knows this? How??)
2) (belief) you are sure that p (you believe it)
3) (external authority) you are justified in being sure that p (e.g., some authority tells you)
4) (hidden false beliefs) you didn't infer p from a false belief (possibly unconscious false belief)
5) (sensitivity to truth) if p hadn't been true, you wouldn't have believed it
6) (accuracy) your beliefs on these matters are mostly accurate
7) (reliability) you believe p by a reliable method (how I know p (the method I have used to come to the belief)) and can be used by others

What is a reliable method? :-)

Well, that's "conceptual analysis of knowledge"... by epistemologists..

How to improve re-use (design and migration)?

ALX does a decent job for auto re-use of custom/analog layout.
But, we can do better...

Think big leaps!

a) Better rule support (and faster setup)
b) Bigger layout in less time/memory
c) Handle bigger changes (re-floorplanning)
d) Full pcell/pdk support
e) In place modification (even when techa != techb)
f) Stand-alone tool (can be used in Titan/TitanOA/CD/Laker/Zandro or any
other external tool)
g) Clean-up: (old flow, tcl/c++)

save/restore: key for dev/debug/test/sys-integ
abstract flow: a,b,c,d,e
sdl: a (pcells), b, d, e
router: a (wires/vias), c
auto-fix: a (wires/vias)
placer: c

generalized re-use problem:
INPUT: lay-a (full hier), sch-a, sch-b, lay-b (some sub-cells), pdk-b
OUTPUT: lay-b (full hier) lvs clean wrt sch-b, using pcells from pdk-b and minimal drc
SPECIAL-CASE: lay-b is a new version of lay-a (same objects, only edge moves)


1- handle much bigger problems (full-chip?). Just the {alx read cell} on ana_top takes more than 12 hours now.
   abstraction!
2- handle all pcells (and without pcell flow)!
   mapping pcells from one pdk to another is complex. Takes a lot of setup effort (VLM approach)
   But, for ECO product (or ++SDL) we only need to update W/L/NumFinger and re-run pcell eval..
3- handle all rules (handled by auto-fix?)
   general Finite State Machine approach? Purify..
4- automate ECOs
5- large changes.... enable fast and accurate re-routing after (manual) floor-planning/placement changes (SBR integration). Use slides from AMSG technical seminar
6- ++SDL
? What else?

June 9, 2013 2:04 pm
A modern Turkey could yet emerge from the protests
By Kemal Dervis

Tolerance and universalism will help the young country progress, writes
Kemal Dervis

RESIM: Anti-government protesters demonstrate in central Ankara, the Turkish
capital. Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has accused the protesters of
walking ‘arm-in-arm with terrorism’, remarks that could further inflame
public anger after three days of riots.

After turmoil erupted in the Arab world in 2011, a number of western
analysts argued that “the Turkish model” could be an example for other
majority Muslim countries. So the demonstrations that began at the end of
May have sent a very different picture to the world from that of a country
with a well-functioning democracy under the leadership of a conservative
party rooted in political Islam. They have shown that a significant part of
Turkey’s society is unhappy with the paternalistic style of leadership and
with the increasing pressures and constraints on secular lifestyles. 

So is the Turkish model falling apart? Will the faultlines running through
society lead to more instability, violence and repression? A grim scenario
is possible. But I believe that it is also possible that a real Turkish
model will emerge from recent events. 

First, the social movement that spread from the big cities to the entire
country has been broad and inclusive. The protests have unleashed a feeling
of empowerment. A core of secular but largely apolitical youth was joined
by observant Muslims, mid-career professionals, factory workers and many
others. A muezzin at a mosque near Istanbul’s Taksim Square told the police
they could not arrest any of the young people who had taken refuge there. 

The demonstrators have remained largely peaceful and many have tried to
clean up the streets after each day of action. On June 4, the holy Kandil
night of the Muslim calendar, many non-practising young activists prayed
with the practising ones. Moreover, the picture of a couple who had just
got married, the bride in a beautiful white dress, walking down a street to
the applause of protesters, was one of happiness, not despair. The central
message of the activists has not been that they want to topple the
government or impose anything on anybody. They want to be free to live the
way they see fit, drinking or not drinking, holding hands in public or not,
dressing the way they want to dress. An impressive respect has been shown
for individual freedom, diversity and nature.

Second, some senior members of the governing Justice and Development party
quickly admitted that excessive force had been used. President Abdullah Gul
issued conciliatory statements, stressing that democracy is not a regime
that consists of simply winning elections and imposing the will of a
majority on all. Bulent Arinc, deputy prime minister, apologised for the
aggressive use of tear gas by the police. While some conservative
columnists called the young people hooligans manipulated by foreign agents,
other conservatives called for restraint and understanding for some of the
demands of the demonstrators.

There is now the opportunity to build what could turn out to be the real
Turkish model. A large proportion of secular young people have shown that
they respect the beliefs and style of living of their more religious
sisters and brothers – something previous generations often failed to
do. They do not want a return to the period when young women were barred
from universities for wearing headscarves. If conservatives and observant
citizens, in their majority, truly accept that many others want to live
their spirituality in their own independent way, and if the ruling party
realises that it cannot govern effectively without consent of a much larger
majority, then Turkey will finally produce a conservative party that is a
Muslim equivalent of European Christian Democrats. The left-of-centre
opposition too has to embrace fully the diversity that makes up the
country, and become a vibrant alternative. If that happens, Turkey could
truly set an example for others. 

The coming years are crucial. I am optimistic because recent events show a
young country looking forward, but also because of the deep-rooted message
of tolerance and universalism carried across centuries in the memory and
writings of great figures of Anatolian Islam such as Mevlana Rumi, Yunus
Emre or Haci Bektas. Finally, the continued respect shown to the memory of
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, reflects the great
progress on the difficult road to modernity, women’s rights and prosperity
that the republic has already achieved.

Sabanci university and a former Turkish minister of economic affairs

** Sunil
Sunil now has spent about a little more than a year in ALX. He has not only ramped up on Steve's code very well (fixed various tricky bugs as well as implemented difficult enhancement in the old code), but also wrote new code to rewamp the core engine in ALX. We can now generate hierarchy aware bonds and using the enhanced API can simplify hierarchical flow tremendously. It is a pleasure to interact with Sunil. I feel that I can very quickly pass complex tacit knowledge to him and he not only absorbs it, but also voices good opinions to improve things. 
** Mohit
Mohit has spent about two months in ALX, I think. He has been ramping up quite well. It was a pleasure spec'ing the new symmetry solution with him and working out the details. He did a wonderful job implementing it and solved this complex problem very well. He also ramped up very quickly on the (rect2path) code from Verma and was able to fix it to solve customers' problems. 
Going forward, I would like him to work more closely with the rest of the team (Sunil, Shakir, Rahul and myself) and ramp up on all aspects of ALX. He can contribute much more after a little more time with ALX.
** Rahul
I think after a couple of years, Rahul is now much better informed and a better user of ALX. He has done a very good job with the demos and presentations to SiWays. He was also very quick in absorbing the Renesas problem and delivered a solution very quickly using ALX pcell flow. Finally, his contribution to the target abstract layout for STARC is invaluable. Without his work, the layout from STARC would have many DRCs and resolving the LVS issues would take us much longer, jepordizing the STARC deliverables further.
* Abstract
Best designers are best at re-use. They hate to repeat themselves and instead live (by) "DRY". When something works, they use it as is. Otherwise, they see if they can get away with minor modifications. They want to focus their energies on building bigger and better things. Layout migration is the technique that enables chip designers to re-use old custom layout in a new node or a new foundry. In this talk, we will cover latest know-how in layout migration technologies, give specific implementation details from our experience with developing the ALX tool and provide glimpes into future opportunities.

** write up
Highlights:

Under my direct leadership and project managment as well as own coding work and direct first line support to PE, our little team has in 2012 demonstrated that Titan ALX is now a proven tool as well as technology for layout migration. We were able to get a very favorable public relations report from our very first customer this year by switching from VLM to ALX.

As Magma was acquired by Synopsys, I have also given many presentations to share learnings on this work with Paul Lo, Naji, Nari and Shabbir's teams and have arisen as the recognized expert on Layout Migration technology.

I think, given my extensive custom layout background (15+ years in the industry) and the recent success of ALX which I have founded and have been leading since 2008, I would like to be considered for promotion to the next level (Principal Engineer, I think). 

I would like to provide some details next, if they are needed:

When we started 2012, we had just finished the Greendale (IDT, tsmc45) deployment (The very first successful ALX usage by a paying customer) by providing to the customer results for many blocks as well as a push-button solution so they could run Layout Migration with ALX themselves. 

Early in 2012, we took two big risks:

1- the risk of supporting a new foundary (Dongbu 180k), for the first time, on the field, even without having any runset to check our results at Synopsys. The first two quarters of 2012, we were very busy supporting IDT's Dongbu project. Developed many new solutions on the fly. I have personally worked on many new rules/bonds/layers (to support the deep/shallow well structures for isolated power devices in Dongbu 180k).

2- the risk of benchmarking with STARC in Japan in the second half of 2012.

During the first half, we also had the internal goal of improving the ease of use of ALX based on learning from Greendale and Dongbu post-mortems. This effort was very successful. I have contributed by not only directing and supervising the team, but also making many contributions myself (e.g., jbond api, etc.). I can provide a list, if needed..

During the second half, our main focus was STARC with the clear objective of meeting all of their stringent and challenging requirements.

Earlier I have worked witih Himanshu by leading and supervising him on developing abstract flow features to support STARC's goals. Using abstracts for CAPs, we were able to not only bring the runtime from > 1 day to less than 2 hours, but also delivered a solution to STARC whereby MIM caps can be automatically migrated into NMOSCAP!

Unfortunately, Himanshu left during the third quarter, but we were able to respond and adapt to this loss by focusing and speeding up R&D work.

Over the second and third quarters, I have also worked with both Sunil and Himanshu to guide/direct/supervise them so we could re-write critical portions of the ALX system. This has now born ample benefits by helping us meet all requirements from STARC. 

Late in 2012, I have started to help ramp up and consult as well as guide and supervise a new addition to the team: Mohit. He has been able to accomplish two significant results already under my leadership: symmetry bond generation (to support non-uniform sizing changes) and path generation.

Also late in 2012, I have helped define the goals and a flow for Revsonic, directed and supervised Rahul to do the work, but also helped fix all the bugs we encountered myself. In less than a week, we were able to go from a GDS to OA with pcells from PDK using ALX.

* P&R vs ALX
** Two arguments?
1- 1 day is so fast for such a complex analog design. That's fast enough (:-)
2- Use ALX to migrate a much better layout of the same design. 

Time analysis for Layout Design:
1- Manual/custom "beautiful" layout

Estimate for STARC design? 2 weeks? 1 month?

2- Auto P&R + manual fixes

400 minutes (mostly manual effort) < 1 day!

3- Layout migration can use the result of both 1 and 2. But, with 1, the
resulting layout will be better?

ALX can input the best layout possible for any given circuit and migrate
it. Using Auto P&R, one only gets a "mediocre" layout for custom/analog
circuits. So, if we want to compare runtimes, we should look at the total
time/effort needed for the best layout and compare that with ALX time.

Synopsys Feature freeze actually is Titan (development style) code-freeze. Between feature freeze and code-freeze in Synopsys one is supposed to be doing QA, adding regressions and fixing QA reported issues. Between Code-freeze and Release to Ops code goes to CAEs for Beta testing and fixing of issues reported by them. 

So when someone asks for a commitment on release please take end of nov date for specs and early Jan for code-completion. Please clearly state/clarify the assumption you are making on what time frame (for coding) you have in mind for the commitment.

Let us avoid any confusions on this account.

* Evren note: heartlake vet
* TODO: for split pcells, SC_AMP_CORE shows a bug!
* split pcells for dummy fingers
STARC would like separate pcells for dummy fingers. Today we group the dummy
fingers as part of the mos instance. So if the input layout has a device MP0
that has 4 fingers and 2 dummies (dummies are indicated via pcell params), one
on right and one on left, then ALX will create a pcell with 6 fingers with the
name of MP0.

However, what STARC would like to see (in order to get cadence cross-probing
for dummies working as well for the cadence connectivity check to pass), they
would like to create separate pcell instance from the dummy fingers and naming
them according to the following naming convention. Also pls see attached
slides.

Naming specification of dummy MOS devices

<Name_of_instance>[.m(when m > 1)]_<r/l><#_of_dummy>

Example1: MN1_r1

 Name_of_instance:    MN1
 m         :    1    (multiplier)
 r/l         :    r    (dummy location)
 #_of_dummy     :    1

Example2: MN1.1_l2
      MN1.2_l2
 Name_of_instance:    MN1
 m         :    2    (multiplier)
 r/l         :    l    (dummy location)
 #_of_dummy     :    2

If there are any dummy MOS devices, which don't meet that naming specification,
it will be defined later.

*** One cannot have both, the inner and other riches
Our days are so empty, filled with activities of every kind, business,
speculation, meditation, sorrow, and joy. But in spite of all these, our
lives are empty. Strip a man of position, power, or of money, what is he?
He had all that show, outwardly, but he is empty, shallow, inwardly. One
can't have both, the inner and other riches. The inner fullness far
outweighs the outer. One can be robbed of the outer, outer events can
shatter what has been carefully built up; but the inner riches are
incorruptible, nothing can touch them, for they have not been put together
by the mind. - Letters to a Young Friend,21
*** To bring up children without comparison is true education
One is everlastingly comparing oneself with another, with what one is, with
what one should be, with someone who is more fortunate. This comparison
really kills. Comparison is degrading, it perverts one's outlook. And on
comparison one is brought up. All our education is based on it and so is
our culture. So there is everlasting struggle to be something other than
what one is. The understanding of what one is uncovers creativeness, but
comparison breeds competitiveness, ruthlessness, ambition, which we think
brings about progress. Progress has only led so far to more ruthless wars
and misery than the world has ever known. To bring up children without
comparison is true education. [Letters to a Young Friend,18]

** Truth brings freedom, freedom from thought - JKOnline Daily Quotes 
Is there not something which is beyond thought, beyond time, something that is not created by the mind?

Either you have been told about that state, have read about it, or there is the experiencing of it. 

The experiencing of it can never be an experience, a result; it cannot be thought about and, if it is, it is a remembrance and not experiencing. 

You can repeat what you have read or heard, but the word is not the thing; and the word, the very repetition, prevents the state of experiencing. 

That state of experiencing cannot be as long as there is thinking: thought, the result, the effect, can never know the state of experiencing.

Then, how is thought to come to an end? 

See the truth that thought, the outcome of the known, can never be in the state of experiencing: 
experiencing is always the new, thinking is always of the old. See the truth of this, and truth brings freedom, freedom from thought, the result. 

Then there is that which is beyond consciousness, which is neither sleeping nor waking, which is nameless: it is. -

EOU: Generic Interface (IDT)
    -- Generic derived layer support and high-level bond generation api
Coding is done. We have significantly reduced (>5x) the user-level code size and complexity as measured by Dongbu rule implementation. Currently being used for some of the new tsmc28 rules.

CE: Fast Neighborhood Search (IDT)
    -- Efficient constraint generation 
Coding is complete. We will test it as needed by ongoing engagements.

CE: Quality improvements in Hierarchical Output Layout
    -- Preservation of hierarchy in output layout without generation of pop-up shapes
Most of the coding is done. New engine code (without hbonds) is tested extensively using regressions. Two major items remain (for Himanshu): handling of shared vias (in progress) and generation of hierarchical result from LP solution

Non MBO item: Support for various new complex DRC rules for tsmc28.

Dependencies:
  Feedback and testing from IDT is very positive.

Risks:
  STARC seems to require extensive use of abstract cell feature. This may overload our resources.

If I get it Monday, you will have it back Tuesday ;)  I don’t enjoy holding on user systems so I ship them right back out :P

If you can back-up your data and removed from the system, the process will definitely speed up, less work for me – less time to complete the integration.

Thanks,

Hi Yves,

Thank you for your email!

My cell phone: +1 404 964 4111
skype: bulent2k2

My last day of work in US will be next Friday (May 25th) and then I am traveling oversees. I just want to make sure the computer will be back at my address (2455 Echo DR NE, Atlanta, GA 30345) by then. 

So, if I send it out today with UPS overnight, it should be there by Monday morning. When can you send it back to me?

Also, do I need to back up the system here? Or, is the user data going to be preserved during the reimaging process?

Thanks a lot in advance,
Bulent

Hi Bulent,

I am going to assign this CCT to Yves Velazco in our US54 office.  He is the closest admin to you.  He can coordinate with you to have your system shipped and reimaged.

Hi Bulent,

I have created CCT 2000291826 to track your reimage.  I am in the process of finding a Windows administrator that can do the reimage.  You will need to ship your laptop to them, as we don’t have an office that is close by to you.  I will let you know who to ship it to shortly.

There is a cutover happening tomorrow that you may have already been informed about.  After tomorrow you will no longer be receiving mail to your Magma account.  All mail that comes to your Magma address will be forwarded to your Synopsys address.  This means you will need to VPN in to the Synopsys network if you still wish to use Outlook to receive mail.  The other option is to use webmail in DSA.
There won’t be any changes made to the engineering infrastructure so you will still be able to access those Magma computers.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,
Andrew

Subject: Questions about computer integration with Synopsys
Hi Bulent,
 
I am going to be assisting you to help get your computer integrated onto the Synopsys network.  I had a few questions that I am hoping you can answer that will help speed up this process.  Please fill in your responses underneath the questions below:
 
What type of computer do you have? (Laptop or desktop?  What manufacturer and model is it?  i.e. Dell E6410 Laptop)
 
Dell Latitude E4200 Laptop
 
What is your address?  (We need to determine if it is easier for you to go onsite to a nearby Synopsys office, or if you will need to ship your computer to us to be reimaged)
 
Until May 25, 2012, my address is:
 
2455 Echo DR NE
Atlanta, GA 30345, USA
 
After May 25, until early August, I will be working from Turkey. Hope we can do the reimaging before May 25th. Otherwise, we'll need to wait until August :-)
 
That’s it for now.  I may have some follow up questions later.  Please send me your responses when you get a chance.
 
Thanks!

  The following are the instruction on getting outlook content on your iPhone. Please DO NOT share these details with any of the other users. It will not work. Access is restricted based on usernames. You have to be approved by IT to connect

If attemting to configure at a Synopsys location, turn off your wi-fi connection before configuring.
1) On your phone, go to Settings | Mail, Contacts, Calendars and select Add Account...
2) Select Microsoft Exchange
3) In the Exchange account information screen, enter the following:
       -Email: username@synopsys.com
             -Domain: synopsys
       -Username: username
       -Password: Windows Password (Do not use the following special characters !,# or $ )
       -Use SSL: ON
(Note: On an iPhone 3GS running firmware 3.0 the 'Use SSL' switch is not shown, but configuration seemed to work fine without.)  
Info for iPhone OS 3.1.3 and iPhone OS 4 Setting
       -Email: username@synopsys.com
       -Domain: synopsys
       -Username: username
       -Password: Windows Password (Do not use the following special characters !,# or $ )
4) Select Next to proceed. (It will time out because it cannot find the mail server. It may also give you an error that it could not validate the certificate and ask you to accept manually or cancel.  After accepting, it should then provide you the mail server options.)
5) Enter Mail Server Name : mail.synopsys.com for exchange 2007 or mobile.synopsys.com for exchange 2010
6) Use ActiveSync by turning ON Mail, Contacts, and Calendar

(Note: When you select 'ON' for Contacts and Calendar, your phone will ask you whether you want to keep or delete the existing items already on the phone.  If you have been sync'ing these to your phone through iTunes already and if you elect to keep the existing items, your phone will end up with duplicates of every contact and every calendar item.)

(Once you are getting Calendar and Contacts pushed from Exchange, you may wish to change your iTunes settings to not sync these same items to avoid possible duplication of data.)

7) Your phone will also ask you to set a new passcode if you have not already been using a passcode to lock the phone.  This passcode is strictly related to the phone and has no bearing on your SNPS or Exchange passwords.  Once it is set, when you "slide to unlock" your phone it will then prompt you for a passcode - this is the same code.

8) It is possible that after setting everything up there are no emails showing up in your iPhone.  Go back through the settings page on the phone and delete the account, then set up again as above in steps 1-6.  Adding the account a second time seems to help in these cases.

9) If we do not receive your Synopsys issue mobile device in a week's time, your iPhone access will be discontinued. Please interoffice your device to Mark Ngo. Mail Stop C1.332A 

10) If you fail in connection for the first time using 3G, try to connect through WiFi first.  After that, you can be connected through 3G, also.

* how small is an atom 4/27/2012 -- you tube: ted ed how small atom
- you know that everything is made of atoms, like all lego toys are made of lego bricks
- electrons on the outside, protons and neutrons on the inside..
- if a grapefruit was filled with nitrogen atoms, how many atoms would there
be in it? a lot. myriad? a lot more. googleplex? maybe?
- to get an idea, let's blow up each nitrogen atom to the size of a
blueberry. How big would the grapefruit get? As big as the earth!
- it is even crazier than that! The small atom has an even smaller nucleus.
If you made the blueberry, atom as big as a two story house, and looked
inside, the n would be barely visible. What is between the electrons and
the n? EMPTY SPACE!
- if we were to blow the blueberry to the side of a football stadium, 
how big would the nucleus be? as big as a small marble in the middle!
- now electrons are very light. they fly :-) almost all the mass of an atom
is in the nucleus. So, how dense is the tiny marble?
if we were to pack cars into a 1-foot-by-1-foot-by-1-foot box, how many
would we have to squeeze in to get the density of the nucleus? As many as
number of people in the world! (more than 6 billion)

* update ??
One further question on "derived" layers for this CR: there are special hard-coded names we have/use in the code today that are derived from other layers internally. We commonly refer to, e.g., gate, ndiff, pdiff, srdpo, pres, odres, etc.., as value for an argument of "alx layer tag" type. 
Another example is {air poly extract spacer x}. This identifies poly spacers, I think. 
* selecting mols and adding bonds on them
We have 4 main mechanisms to "select" mols in order to apply specific bonds on them:

1- We generate a molcell (edbCell) from mols and use the following API:
  a) {alx select *} -- global operation on the whole chem
  b) edb* -- local operation on a given mol
  c) alx::molcell::get_cuts_of_obj|mid -- local operation on a given mol

{alx add constraint}, or the GUI, can then be used to add bonds.

2- We refer to input coordinates to select molecules:
    set mid [alx::identifyo <tag> <x> <y>]
  This can be done without a molcell.
 
Then, we can add bonds using {alx set param air_customs_tcl|air_custom} or redefining alx::get_custom_bonds.

3- We select directly from airdb using a variety of custom filters:
    air extractu <cover_layer> <layer> <x_layer> [-inv] [-remove]
    air copy under <cover_layer> <layer> <x_layer> [-inv 1]
    air append <x_layer> <layer>
    air diff|poly extract ...

air width|spacing|enc|ext|overlap|hook|alignment|interabut|local can then be used to add bonds.

4- Custom api that look for specific layers/patterns and add specific bonds. E.g., 
    air spacings|symmetry|npspacing|polyhook|extendp|abut|npspacing|notchspacing
    air bjtdmy|rpdmy|nwdmy
    ...
** ??
0- fix boundary mol to identify critical cut
1- alx run solver (default: -continue and -hflow)
   Fix for Shakir: alx get molcell -hflow creates molcell in alx lib NOT alxh if no hier! (-cut_info is default, too!)
2- CR for Sunil -- diffms : orders all m1 and diff edges. Not good! (Already have proximity bond!)

Margaret Thatcher, A Life
By The Editors of New Word City

Purchase the iBooks edition of Margaret Thatcher, A Life

The date was Monday May 31, 1982. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
was in her office at 10 Downing Street dealing with the greatest crisis of
her career when an aide alerted her to an important phone call. President
Ronald Reagan was on the line from the White House. As the two leaders
spoke, British troops were engaged in a messy war 8,000 miles from London,
on the tiny Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic. Two months earlier
Argentina had invaded the islands, over which both countries claimed
sovereignty. Britain's counterattack had ignited cries of "colonialism"
from Latin America's left, complicating American efforts in support of the
region's more right-wing regimes. Reagan asked Thatcher to call a cease
fire and settle the conflict diplomatically.

Thatcher and Reagan were great friends and allies, his opinion usually
carried great weight. But that afternoon Reagan was no match for Thatcher's
determination to do what she felt was best for her country. "Suppose Alaska
was invaded," she said heatedly. "Now you've put all your people up there
to retake it and someone suggested that a contact could come in. You
wouldn't do it."

"No, no," Reagan replied. "Although, Margaret, I have to say I don't think
Alaska is a similar situation . . ." "More or less so," she snapped. "I
didn't lose some of my best ships and some of my finest lives to leave
quietly under a ceasefire without the Argentines withdrawing."

No indeed. When the unpopular junta of General Leopoldo Galtieri decided to
invade the Falklands in an attempt to awaken national pride and divert the
Argentine people from an ongoing economic crisis, Thatcher's military
advisers counseled restraint. But Thatcher was deeply offended by this
assault on British sovereignty. She sent British troops, aircraft, and
warships, including a hastily refitted Queen Elizabeth II, to face the best
navy in South America and Argentina's formidable air force. Thatcher's
outnumbered troops were fighting hand-to-hand to reclaim the islands, five
British warships had been sunk, and victory was by no means in hand.

Reagan noted that his plan called for Galtieri's troops to leave the
islands. Once again, Thatcher dismissed his argument and Reagan grew ever
more defensive, "Margaret, but I thought that part of this proposal
. . . Margaret, I . . . Yes, well . . . Well, Margaret, I know that I've
intruded and I know how . . ."

"You've not intruded at all, and I'm glad you telephoned." Click.

Ronald Reagan had just come up against one of history's great immovable
forces: Margaret Thatcher's determination to do what she felt was in
Britain's best interests. During her long and at times contentious career
even her most ardent enemies never questioned her sincerity or her faith in
and love for her country.

As for the Falklands War, two weeks later Argentina surrendered. Within
days of his defeat, Galtieri was removed from office, and the following
year democracy returned to Argentina. (Interestingly both nations still
claim sovereignty over the islands, though today they're allies and have
put the issue aside for now.)

The military victory was just what the dispirited Brits â¬ beaten down by a
long economic crisis of their own â¬ needed. Patriotic fervor swept the
nation. Two years into her tenure as Prime Minister, the Iron Lady had
proven what she was made of. Thatcher's support at home skyrocketed, and
her Conservative government won a resounding victory in the 1983 elections.

While the Falklands War demonstrated Thatcher's courage and belief in her
nation, it also showcased her equally formidable political skills. When the
conflict began, her economic policies â¬ which were centered on austerity
and reigning in the powerful unions â¬ seemed to be failing and her approval
rating had dropped as low as 23 percent. Fully a quarter of Britain's
manufacturing had gone dark; unemployment was at levels not seen since the
Great Depression; riots were convulsing the major cities. Thatcher's
government faced a Parliamentary vote of no confidence, which would have
doomed it. Then came the Falklands War, making her a symbol of all that was
great, strong and timeless about her proud nation. When the Argentines
surrendered on June 14, 1982 vast crowds gathered in London to hail
Thatcher and sing "Rule Britannia."

Adi tanidik geliyor ama ben de yazari tanimiyorum. Giris ve sonuc paragraflarina katiliyorum. Ama arada yazdiklarinin bunlari desteklediklerinden emin degilim, dolayisiyla dagitmis gibi geldi bana. Ozellikle Kanuni elestirisini yalnizca konuyla ilgisiz degil, ayni zamanda haksiz buldum: Ornegin, ondan eser kalmamis olmasi yalnizca onunla ilgili degil, ondan sonrakilerle ilgili olabilir; ornegin bundan 30-40 yil (veya daha yakin?!) sonra Ataturk'ten de cok az eser kalmis olabilecegini (en azindan o zaman okutulacak tarih baglaminda) dusunursek, bu durum Kanuni ile ilgili olmayabilir. Diger taraftan Kanuni'nin kanunlarindan, Osmanli'yi genisletmesinden bahsetmemis hic. 

Neyse, Gulendam'in kompozisyon elestirisi gibi oldu. Aslinda 'cehalet' uzerinde yorum yapmak istedim. Yazar hemen universite siralamsina getirmis, ben de 'egitim endeksi' siralamasi buldum (bugun istatistik gunum!: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Index) ama egitim icin okulun, okuma yazmanin yani sira ailelerin, aslinda toplumun deger yargilarinin gercekten cok onemli oldugunu dusunuyorum. Hani bizim ogrenciligimizde 'ogretim degil egitim' gibi sloganlastirilirdi ya, bence millet olarak egitim bizim icin hala buyuk bir zayiflik, ve sanki son 30 yilda ekonomik olarak gayet yuksek seviyelerde buyurken bu konuda biraz yerimizde saydik?

Ben bu konu ile ilgili derinlemesine yorum yapabilecek bilgiye sahip olmadÄ±ÄxÄ±mÄ± itiraf etmek zorunda olmakla beraber, KanunÃ®â¬"nin Yavuz Selimâ¬"den altÄ±n dolu olarak teslim aldÄ±ÄxÄ± hazineyi tÃ¼kettiÄxi gibi bir pratik bilgiye ve ayrÄ±ca temel OsmanlÄ± bilgisinden kendisinden sonraki dÃ¶nemin â¬Sduraklamaâ¬ý ve hemen ardÄ±ndan â¬Sgerilemeâ¬ý diye anÄ±lan bir padiÅxah olmasÄ±yla 46 yÄ±llÄ±k hÃ¼kÃ¼mdarlÄ±ÄxÄ±nda â¬Skocamanâ¬ý imparatorluÄxun kendisinden sonraki bekasÄ± ve geliÅximi iÃ§in hiÃ§bir temel bÄ±rakmamÄ±Åx olmasÄ± Ã§Ä±karÄ±mÄ±nÄ± yapabiliyorum.

Neyse, aslÄ±nda yazÄ±nÄ±n burasÄ± da o kadar Ã¶nemli deÄxildi. Ä°Ã§inden Ã§Ä±karÄ±lacak en temel saptama sonuÃ§ paragrafÄ±nda â¬Scehaleteâ¬ý Ã§atan satÄ±rlarÄ±ydÄ±. En azÄ±ndan burada adamÄ±n hakkÄ±nÄ± yiyemeyeceÄximiz konusunda hemfikir olacaÄxÄ±mÄ±zÄ± tahmin ediyorum ki sen de Yunus 100 ile ÅxÃ¼pheye yer bÄ±rakmayacak Åxekilde bunun altÄ±nÄ± Ã§izmiÅxsin.

Bu toplumun hemen hiÃ§bir deÄxeri kalmadÄ±: Tek deÄxer, kiÅxilerin ve/veya gruplarÄ±n hak etmedikleri Åxeylere uzanmak iÃ§in olabilen her yolu denemesinin en makbul marifet sayÄ±lmasÄ±dÄ±r. 
  
TÃ¼rkiye rÃ¼Åxvet ve hÄ±rsÄ±zlÄ±kta Avrupa birincisi, dÃ¼nya dÃ¶rdÃ¼ncÃ¼sÃ¼dÃ¼r. DÃ¼nya Ã¼lkeleri arasÄ±nda cahillik dÃ¼zeyiyle en Ã¶n saflarda yer alÄ±yor, dÃ¼nya Ã¼niversiteleri arasÄ±nda adÄ± anÄ±labilecek ilk 500 arasÄ±nda hiÃ§bir Ã¼niversitesi yoktur. 
  
BaÅxta CumhurbaÅxkanÄ± ve BaÅxbakan olmak Ã¼zere devleti yÃ¶netenlerin hakkÄ±nda bulunan suÃ§ dosyalarÄ± nedeniyle dÃ¼nya birincisidir (Kemal BaytaÅx, SÃ¶zcÃ¼ 13 Å~ubat 2011). 
  
Ä°Ã§eri atÄ±lan gazetecilerin sayÄ±sÄ±yla dile gelen aykÄ±rÄ± fikre tahammÃ¼lde, nihayet Ä°ran ve Ã!in'in bile gerisine dÃ¼Åxerek sondan birinciliÄxi kaptÄ±. 
  
GÃ¼n geÃ§miyor ki Ä±rzÄ±na geÃ§ilen kadÄ±n, cinsiyet nedeniyle veya tÃ¶re denen ahlaksÄ±zlÄ±klar yÃ¼zÃ¼nden Ã¶ldÃ¼rÃ¼len kÄ±z ve kadÄ±n haberleri gazetelerimizde, televizyonlarÄ±mÄ±zda yer almasÄ±n. 
  
En son Ã¶Äxrencilerimizi hatta devlete ait kurumlar ve devletin memurlarÄ± eliyle harcamak, onlarÄ±n hayatlarÄ±nÄ± karartmak sÄ±radan olay oldu, bunlarÄ± yapan ve kÃ¶tÃ¼ niyetleri artÄ±k her gÃ¼n dile gelen akÄ±l ve beceri fakirleri devletin ve hÃ¼kÃ¼metin gÃ¼vencesi altÄ±na alÄ±ndÄ±. 
  
MHP Grup BaÅxkanvekili Oktay Vural Bey bu konuda devlet gÃ¶revlilerinin â¬Statmin oldukâ¬ý sÃ¶zlerinde suÃ§ ortaklÄ±ÄxÄ±nÄ±n dile geldiÄxini televizyonlardan haykÄ±rdÄ±. 
  
TÃ¼m bunlar ne zaman oluyor? MuhafazakÃ¢r deÄxerlerimizin ÅxahlandÄ±ÄxÄ±, AtatÃ¼rk'Ã¼n getirdiÄxi akÄ±lcÄ±lÄ±ktan hÄ±zla uzaklaÅxtÄ±ÄxÄ±mÄ±z bir dÃ¶nemde; TÃ¼rkiye halkÄ± tamamen keÃ§ileri kaÃ§Ä±rdÄ± mÄ±, yoksa bu ahlaksÄ±zlÄ±klar zÃ¼mresi onun gerÃ§ek deÄxerlerini mi yansÄ±tÄ±yor? 
  
Bence ne biri ne diÄxeri. Halk o kadar cahilleÅxti ki, yaptÄ±ÄxÄ± Åxeylerin veya kendisine yapÄ±lanlarÄ±n Ã§oÄxunun ahlaksÄ±zlÄ±k olduÄxunu, bu ahlaksÄ±zlÄ±klarÄ±n er veya geÃ§ kendisini zarara uÄxratacaÄxÄ±nÄ±, Ã§oluk-Ã§ocuÄxunu sÃ¼rÃ¼ndÃ¼receÄxini gÃ¶remez hale geldi, safsatayla uyutulmayÄ± tercih eder oldu. 
  
TÃ¼rkiye halkÄ± kravat takar, lÃ¼ks otomobillerde dolaÅxÄ±r, bikinili hatunlarÄ± sosyetik plajlarÄ± doldurur veya Åxehirlerini Åxekilsiz gÃ¶kdelenlerle doldurup oralarÄ± â¬Smodernizeâ¬ý ederek yaÅxanmaz hale getirir, ama tÃ¼m bu halk zenginiyle fakiriyle, Åxehirlisiyle kÃ¶ylÃ¼sÃ¼yle zÄ±r cahildir. Kendi tarihinden habersizdir. AslÄ±nda ne dilini, ne dinini bilir, negeleneklerini tanÄ±r, ne de toplumsal deÄxerlerinin evriminden haberdardÄ±r. 
  
MuhteÅxem YÃ¼zyÄ±l diye televizyonlarda alkÄ±ÅxladÄ±ÄxÄ± dÃ¶nemde, devletinde Amerika'dan gelen gÃ¼mÃ¼ÅxÃ¼n ilk enflÃ¢syonu baÅxlattÄ±ÄxÄ±nÄ± bilmez (Ã§Ã¼nkÃ¼ AvrupalÄ± â¬SgÃ¢vurâ¬ý dÃ¼nyayÄ± keÅxfederken, muhteÅxem [!] padiÅxahlarÄ± hareminde gÃ¶nÃ¼l eÄxlendirmekte, dÃ¼nyayÄ± Ã¶Äxrenelim diyen PirÃ® Reis'in kafasÄ±nÄ± vurdurmaktadÄ±r). 
  
MuhteÅxem (!) yÃ¼zyÄ±lda Anadolu'da medrese o kadar ayaÄxa dÃ¼ÅxmÃ¼ÅxtÃ¼r ki, Ã¶Äxrenci haydutluÄxa baÅxlamÄ±ÅxtÄ±r (buna softa ÅxekÃ¢veti denir). 
  
Avrupa'da ilk yenilgimizi MuhteÅxem (!) SÃ¼leyman devrinde aldÄ±ÄxÄ±mÄ±z gibi (I.Viyana bozgunu: 1529), Hint Okyanusuna her Ã§Ä±kÄ±ÅxÄ±mÄ±zda mini mini Portekiz'den sopayÄ± yiyip KÄ±zÄ±ldeniz'e veya Basra KÃ¶rfezi'ne tÄ±kÄ±lÄ±ÅxÄ±mÄ±z da bu bÃ¼yÃ¼k (!) padiÅxah efendimizin devrindedir. Gene onun zamanÄ±nda dÃ¼nya keÅxfedilirken, Hint Okyanusu'na kadÄ±rga denen sandallarla aÃ§Ä±lan ve 1554'te Hindistan'da karaya vuran bÃ¼yÃ¼k (!) bir amiralimiz, yÃ¼rÃ¼yerek Ã¼Ã§ senede Hindistan'dan Edirne'ye gelmiÅx ve meÅxhur bir kitap (MirÃ¢t-Ã¼l MemÃ¢lik) yazmÄ±ÅxtÄ±. 
  
El alemin dÃ¼nyayÄ± Ã¶ÄxrendiÄxi bu dÃ¶nemde SeydÃ® Ali Reis gazel sÃ¶yleyip, eÄxlence partilerini anlatmaktan baÅxka tek bir detaylÄ± coÄxrafya bilgisi toplamayÄ± gerekli bulmamÄ±ÅxtÄ±. 
  
BÃ¼yÃ¼k (!) SultanÄ±mÄ±z SÃ¼leyman'Ä±n Fransa kralÄ± I. FranÃ§ois'yÄ± hapisten bir mektupla kurtardÄ±ÄxÄ±nÄ± okurduk mektepte. O FranÃ§ois'nÄ±n kurduÄxu CollÃ¨ge de France bugÃ¼n dÃ¼nyanÄ±n en Ã¶nemli araÅxtÄ±rma kurumlarÄ±ndan biridir. Bizimkinin hangi kurumu ayakta kaldÄ±? Hangi kurumunun insanlÄ±Äxa beÅx paralÄ±k bir faydasÄ± oldu? Tek becerdiÄxi kalÄ±cÄ± Åxey, aklÄ± baÅxÄ±nda Ã¶z oÄxlu Å~ehzade Mustafa'yÄ± HÃ¼rrem uÄxruna katlettirip, devleti bir ayyaÅxa teslim ederek halkÄ±nÄ±n geleceÄxini karartmak oldu. 
  
ArtÄ±k yeter! Bu ve benzeri rezillikleri yalanlarla bezeyip yÃ¼celten, buna karÅxÄ±lÄ±k bize bÃ¼tÃ¼n dÃ¼nyada saygÄ±nlÄ±k kazandÄ±ran, aklÄ±mÄ±zÄ± kullanÄ±p onurlu insanlar olmamÄ±zÄ± saÄxlayan AtatÃ¼rk'Ã¼ aÅxaÄxÄ±layan Ã¢lim pozlu, ukala tavÄ±rlÄ± zÄ±r cahilleri her gÃ¼n halkÄ±n karÅxÄ±sÄ±na diken televizyon kanallarÄ±ndan ve gazetelerden gÄ±na geldi. YÃ¼kselen ahlaksÄ±zlÄ±k grafiÄximiz kimin eseridir sanÄ±yorsunuz? Cehalet tÃ¼m fenalÄ±klarÄ±n anasÄ±dÄ±r. Biz de o anayÄ± besleyip duruyor, onun tosuncuklarÄ±na oylar veriyoruz. ArtÄ±k yeter! Memleketimde her elimi attÄ±ÄxÄ±m yerde cehalet Ã§irkefine bulaÅxmaktan bÄ±ktÄ±m.

VarlÄ±k niye ve nasÄ±l var?
27 Temmuz 2011 Ã!arÅxamba 03:00
E-Posta GÃ¶nder

Temel sorulardan biri hatta ilki, insanÄ±n kendine dair deÄxil midir?
VarlÄ±k sorunu ve anlam tÃ¼m sorularÄ±n anasÄ±dÄ±r.
Misafirime bunu sordum: 'VarlÄ±k neden ve nasÄ±l var?''
'YÃ¼ce ve eÅxsiz TanrÄ± sayÄ±ya sÄ±Äxmayan gÃ¼zel isimlerinin suretlerini gÃ¶rmek
diledi.'' diyerek lafa girdi, 'GÃ¼zel kardeÅxim, etrafÄ±na baktÄ±ÄxÄ±nda ne Ã§ok
Åxey gÃ¶rÃ¼yorsun deÄxil mi? Fakat aslÄ±nda sadece Allah var ve onunla birlikte
baÅxka hiÃ§bir Åxey yok. Gel zamana taÅxÄ± kendini. Bak nasÄ±l her Åxeyin
baÅxladÄ±ÄxÄ±nÄ± ve sona erdiÄxini gÃ¶rÃ¼yorsun. Yoktu, var oldu, yok oldu. Mademki
her Åxey belirip yok olmakta. Kabul et ki hiÃ§bir Åxey yoktu sadece Allah
vardÄ±. Allah Ã§oklukta var. Fakat biz Ã§okluÄxun sihrine dÃ¼ÅxÃ¼p her bir Åxeyi
kendiyle var zannediyoruz. AyrÄ± ayrÄ± ebedi ve ezeli var sanÄ±yoruz. Ã!okluÄxun
bir bÃ¼tÃ¼n olarak yokluÄxunu gÃ¶rmediÄximizden varlÄ±ÄxÄ±n var olduÄxu halde
sÃ¼rekli olmadÄ±ÄxÄ±nÄ± fark edemiyoruz. Oysa dÃ¼n Ã¶lÃ¼dÃ¼r. VarlÄ±ÄxÄ± oluÅxturan her
bir cÃ¼z sÃ¼rekli deÄxiÅxiyor. Her an her Åxey var olmakta ve yeniden yok
olmakta. Bir Ã¶nceki Ã¶ldÃ¼ bir sonraki dirildi. Her yeni eskiyi yok
ediyor. FrekansÄ± sÄ±kÄ±laÅxtÄ±rÄ±rsan ne gÃ¶receksin? Her an bir yeni var. Peki
ya bu da yoksa? Anlam isimlerle taÅxÄ±nmÄ±yor mu? Yani her Åxeyin bir adÄ± yok
mu? Å~eyler isimlerdir... Bu isimler Allah'Ä±n isimleri... O, sayÄ±ya sÄ±Äxmayan
isimlere sahip. O, sayÄ±ya sÄ±Äxmayan isimleri; kendi isimlerini gÃ¶rmek
istedi. Yani suretler oluÅxtu. Rahmet diyorsun mesela. CanlÄ±lar olmasaydÄ±
rahmet bilinir miydi? Merhamet canlÄ± suretlerden belirir. Dirilik de bir
isim. AynÄ± anda tÃ¼m canlÄ±lar gÃ¶zlerini kapatsa gÃ¶rÃ¼len ne var?
Yokluk... EÅxya da karanlÄ±k. EÅxya dediÄximizi ortaya Ã§Ä±karan hayat deÄxil mi?
Belki Ã¶yle sÄ±fatlar var ki mevcut canlÄ±lÄ±k katmanÄ± Ã¶yle bir aza sahibi
olmadÄ±ÄxÄ±ndan bilinmiyor ve gÃ¶rÃ¼lmÃ¼yorlar. Var ve ayn da yok o
isimler. 'Peki say bana o isimleri? NasÄ±l sayabilirim sureti yok ki? 

GÃ¶rmek sÄ±nÄ±rlÄ±lÄ±ktÄ±r. GÃ¶rmek karanlÄ±kta beliren bir yÄ±ldÄ±z gibidir. Daha
nice yÄ±ldÄ±zlar vardÄ±r. Ona gÃ¶rme de denemez. Belki mÃ¶rme diye bir Åxey
var. Ve onu ancak mÃ¶rme ile bilebiliriz... 

Mevlana diyor ki, 'AltÄ± yÃ¶n beÅx duyu Ã¶tesi'...Yani bu bir
sÄ±nÄ±rlÄ±lÄ±ktÄ±r. GerÃ§ek ile hakikat bambaÅxka Åxeylerdir. GerÃ§ek gÃ¼ncel
olgular. Ama hakikat, Ã¶tesidir. Hakikatte ne var? Hakikat gerÃ§eÄxi iÃ§erir
elbette... Ama hakikat gerÃ§eÄxin Ã¶tesidir. AÅxkÄ±ndÄ±r.'' 

DoÄxuÅxtan kÃ¶re renkleri tarif edemeyiz mesela deÄxil mi?

O bile gÃ¶rmenin gÃ¶lgesindedir. Å~unu bir dÃ¼ÅxÃ¼n gÃ¼zel kardeÅxim, mesela bir
Ã§ocuk doÄxsa ve alnÄ±nda bilinmedik bir organ Ã§Ä±ksa. GÃ¶z desen gÃ¶z deÄxil,
kulak desen kulak deÄxil. Bir iÅx gÃ¶rÃ¼yor... Ama diÄxer insanlarda
yok. Ä°nsanlarda aynÄ± organlar olduÄxu iÃ§in O organla beÅx duyumuzla
bildiklerimiz sayÄ±ya sÄ±Äxar. YaratÄ±lmÄ±ÅxÄ± parÃ§aladÄ±ÄxÄ±nda isimlerden baÅxka Åxey
kalmaz. Her Åxey isimlere ayrÄ±ÅxtÄ±ÄxÄ±nda o isimlerden meydana gelen Åxey de yok
olur.  

Ä°nsanÄ±n maddi olmayan varlÄ±ÄxÄ± hakiki varlÄ±ÄxÄ± odur...

Ä°nsanÄ±n sanatÄ± o insanÄ±n sÄ±rrÄ±dÄ±r. SanatÃ§Ä± o resmi nasÄ±l yapÄ±yor? Bir akis
dÃ¼ÅxÃ¼yor ve onu ortaya Ã§Ä±karmak istiyor. O akis ne zaman iÃ§ dÃ¼nyasÄ±ndan dÄ±Åxa
vurur, 'Ben bir Åxey yapacaÄxÄ±m der ve o duyguya bir suret yapar. Budur
dediÄxinde o tablo olur.' O tablo yoktu. Nereden yaptÄ±? Var mÄ±ydÄ±?
Yoktu... Ä°Åxte TanrÄ±'yÄ± da bÃ¶yle bil. Sani sanatÃ§Ä± demektir. 

Bu da bir koordinat. DÄ±Åx alem var iÃ§ alem var. SanatÃ§Ä± sanat derdine ne
zaman dÃ¼Åxer? Ä°Ã§inde bir titreÅxim olur ve bu yeni bir beliriÅx, iÅx doÄxurur. 

Kimisi yapar kimi arar. Allah'Ä±n isimlerinden biri de Sani'dir. SanatÃ§Ä±
yani... Sani'nin sunumuna akÄ±llar ermez. SanatÃ§Ä±nÄ±n sanatÄ±na akÄ±llar
ermez.

** August 2011 -- The Evolution of Awareness
*** Toward Self-Realization
Eckhart describes our progression from ordinary consciousness to the awakened state as our fundamental foundation for living.
*** Eckhart Tolle and Neale Donald Walsch in Conversation
A moving dialogue on topics including Nealeâ¬"s personal story, his creative process, the challenge of staying spiritually awake in daily living, and more.
*** On what basis can you tell people to accept whatever life situation they are put in?
Eckhart makes an important clarification about his teaching on accepting the present moment.
*** Could you explain faith in the way Jesus spoke about it?
When you see the power of life within you and can fully be who you are in your essence, explains Eckhart, that is faith in action.
*** I feel like a boulder is covering up my thoughts and emotions. Help!
Eckhart speaks with a questioner from Austria about dealing with the pain-body and personal uncertainty.
*** Can the ego surrender itself to the light of consciousness?
An eloquent summation of the dysfunctional mind pattern that is the egoâ¬and what happens to it in the face of awareness.
*** Whatâ¬"s the difference between the exercises in A Course in Miracles and your teaching of stillness?
Reminding us that words are always only pointers, Eckhart discusses some of the ways that the Course helps us use relationships as spiritual practice.
*** Can you comment about how â¬Sthe journey is ours alone but we are all on it?â¬ý
Kim fields a question concerning relating to others from a place of true connection instead of through a social role.
** Copyright Â© 2011 Eckhart Teachings Inc., All rights reserved.
** July -- Midwifing the New Consciousness - A conversation with Eckhart Tolle & Marianne Williamson
*** Eckhart joins Marianne Williamson in a spiritual inquiry concerning humanityâ¬"s evolution and our individual roles.
*** Is â¬Sgood or badâ¬ý an illusion created by the mind?
Eckhart and Marianne reflect on the crucial difference between judgment and the â¬Sdescriptionâ¬ý of a person or event.
*** How can a movement that is inwardly focused demonstrate political power?
Marianne Williamson shares powerful examples of the many triumphs of non-violent movements in recent history.
*** How do we discuss our spiritual beliefs with our children?
Eckhart and Marianne talk about the relationship between beliefs, knowledge, and universal law.
*** If things around me are an illusion, should I still remain active and participate?
Eckhart and Marianne discuss the intersection between global activism and spiritual practice.
*** Is there part of usâ¬a soulâ¬or an energy that transcends death?
Eckhart describes what it looks like to â¬Splayâ¬ý in the realm of form rather than seeking self-realization in forms.
*** How do we explain the process of death to a child?
Eckhart reminds us to keep things experiential rather than conceptual when discussing the fleeting nature of forms with our children.
*** What is forgiveness? Is it different from compassion or the Buddhist concept of bodhicitta?
Eckhart illuminates the nature of forgiveness, reminding us of the realm wherein it becomes unnecessary.
*** Can you comment on moving energy through the body?
Kim talks about the fluid nature of energy and the healing potential of stillness.

Dear Friends, 

This month, Eckhart Tolle TV brings to you, a very special edition: A feature-length collection of 'Eckhart Answers'. This issue will highlight some of the in-depth answers Eckhart has recently provided in response to some particularly intriguing questions from our community, such as: 

Since having a spiritual experience, my life is missing its old passion. Can you please comment on this?
Is there such a thing as free will?
How can one teach children the rules that we follow in society while also allowing them to be, create, and express themselves?
Are we able to control our minds while sleeping?
Have you ever experienced a dark night of the soul?
What is the relationship between body, mind, soul, and presence?
Should you engage in intimacy even though you're awakening and understand that you don't need a human being to complete you?

Also this month, Kim Eng speaks of balancing our preferences and the 'art of allowing' in intimate relationships (versus having expectations). 

Please enjoy this rich and illuminating special edition of Eckhart Tolle TV. 

Warm Regards, 

Erin Jacobson

*** June 2011 -- A Special Edition of Eckhart Answers Vol 1
A special note about this monthâ¬"s issue: Instead of our customary featured talk, this issue will highlight some of the in-depth answers Eckhart has recently provided in response to some particularly intriguing questions from our community. Please enjoy this rich and illuminating special edition of Eckhart Answers.
*** A Special Edition of Eckhart Answers Vol 1
*** Is there such a thing as free will?
When you experience the freedom of presence, you might find this question irrelevant. Eckhart explains in this illuminating and in-depth response.
*** Since having a spiritual experience my life is missing its old passion. Please comment.
When we stop looking to the outside world for fulfillment and instead live more deeply in the transcendent dimension, it is not uncommon to see surprising changes unfold.
*** What is the relationship between body, mind, soul, and presence?
Eckhart offers a fascinating perspective on the nature of identity in this discussion of â¬SI, the greatest illusion.â¬ý
*** Have you ever experienced the dark night of the soul?
Eckhart describes the painful experiences we must sometimes endure in order for the true self to emerge.
*** Do you have any practical tips for â¬Sletting outâ¬ý that which we want to see come into our lives?
When we think the world is withholding something from us, we must ask ourselves whether or not we can offer that very thing from within.
*** How can one teach children the rules of society while also allowing them to express themselves?
Balance is the key, but Eckhart reminds us that in dealing with children, the â¬Showâ¬ý (or our own consciousness) is more important than the â¬Swhat.â¬ý
*** Should you engage in intimacy even though you donâ¬"t need another human to complete you?
 Itâ¬"s never a question of â¬Üshould,â¬" explains Eckhart. As presence arises, we find fulfillment beyond the level of forms.
*** Are we able to control to our minds while sleeping?
Eckhart makes an important clarification between suppressing thought and true presence.
*** Is it reasonable to expect honesty and openness in a marriage or intimate relationship?
Kim shares a dialogue about balancing our preferences and the art of allowing in intimate partnerships.

* TODO:

** categorize sliver objs w.r.t. master cells they come from -- hsliver report for Shakir
** 2- email to Girish/Himanshu/Ali/Shakir
** 3- flow: a- cut wires with unchanged abstracts TO RENLIN, b- fix parser to support 2u, 400n
** TAXES!

1- None of the shapes from pcells were created in target layout. It only had rectangles corresponding to my poly and M1 paths in src layout. What happened to the pcells?

>> This is a bug we need to fix. I saw this as well. As a workaround, I did "Generate Layout from AVP" and then ran alx. Bug is in chem-a generation (vf code now) which seems to drop the layout from pcells when top-cell viewname is different

2- The grid settings in the target layout is incorrect. It seems the cfg is in alx root does not  have values that match the tsmc pdk. How did you get the titan.cfg that are added to alx/root?

>> Question for Ali. Girish, copy over root and override root/techb/tsmc<nodes-you-want-to-use>/titan.cfg with your cfg. Then do:
   alx setup -techa .. -techb .. -root <path to your copy>

3- The colors and stipple pattern for layer also not same as my src layout when I dint change the tech.

>> Same fix as 2. alx setup -techa tsmc65lp -techb tsmc65lp -root <your own root>

4- The rectangles created in target layout are on dataType 0 and not dataType drawing (252).

>> Reorder layers in alx tag lmap under: root/techb/tsmc66lp/lmap.tcl so that dt 252 comes before 0.
   proc lmap_alx2tsmc65lp {} {
      ...
      m2 {{M2 {32 252}} {M2 {32 0}}}
      ...
   }

5- When I tried tsmc45gs as target tech, the target layout was not opened automatically. It gave an error message about cellId 12 not a valid cell id. It seems someone closes the cell before invoking win open cell command.

>> Bug for Ali to fix. This happens when using titan.libs mode.

6- If the src view name is say myLayout, then the target view name is myLayout. But when I see the cfg of the target library, it does not have an entry corresponding to myLayout.

>> Like in 3, use correct cfg in root. 

7- Every time I change my mouse focus from titan window to ALX GUI, titan hangs for brief period of time (and red light on top banner comes in titan).

>> Bug for Renxi/Ali to fix

>> Two more issues related to titan.libs mode similar to 5:

>> 8- fail to create liba the second time in titanlibs mode (workaround: delete liba first)
>> 9- fail to re-use target lib the second time in titanlibs mode (workaround: delete the libb first)

Words do not express thoughts very well {Thoughts do NOT express reality
very well, in turn}; everything immediately becomes a little different, a
little distorted, a little foolish. And yet it also pleases me and seems
right that what is of value and of wisdom to one individual, seems nonsense
to another.
** Poem
He who travels far will often see things
Far removed from what he believed was truth.
When he talks about it in the fields at home,
He is often accused of lying,
For the obdurate people will not believe
What they do not see and distinctly feel.
Inexperience, I believe
Will give little credence to my song.

Bulent,

Can you go into Control Panel/Add & Remove Programs and select Microsoft Office and click on the Change button? Then when it starts the installer, select Repair and select full install. Then point to here.

* Magma's Titan Supports IPL 1.0 Standard for Interoperable Process Design Kits

SAN JOSE, Calif., May 11, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MagmaÂ® Design Automation Inc. (Nasdaq:LAVA), a provider of chip design software, announced today that the Titanâ¢ Mixed-Signal Platform has been validated to support the interoperability and accuracy requirements of the IPL 1.0 Interoperable Process Design Kit (iPDK) standard. The Interoperable PDK Libraries (IPL) Alliance standard eliminates the need to develop multiple proprietary PDKs and design databases, reducing development costs, shortening delivery schedules and providing designers earlier access to new advanced process technologies across multiple tools. The combination of Titan's advanced capabilities and compliance with the IPL 1.0 standard provides designers with the fastest path to mixed-signal silicon.

"We have already collaborated with Magma to qualify Titan for the first foundry-specific 65-nm iPDK, which TSMC spearheaded," said Tom Quan, deputy director of design methodology and service marketing at TSMC. "TSMC is pleased that the Titan Mixed-Signal Platform also meets the iPDK quality standards set in IPL 1.0. This will help us deliver greater choices and advanced design features to our end customers."

"With the remarkable growth in the number of mixed-signal systems on chip (SoCs), designers need solid analog and digital design solutions that enable them to handle increased complexity while shortening the design cycle," said Anirudh Devgan, general manager of Magma's Custom Design Business Unit. "By working with the IPL Alliance to validate the Titan Mixed-Signal Platform for the new IPL 1.0 standard, Magma helps designers accelerate analog and mixed-signal design without compromising accuracy."

About IPL 1.0

IPL 1.0 is a major accomplishment achieved through the collaboration of IPL Alliance member companies. Semiconductor foundries and integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) can use this standard to build a single iPDK that works with multiple Open Access-based custom design tools, reducing development costs and the need to support vendor-specific PDKs. Electronic design automation (EDA) vendors can use this standard to validate that their tools work with the iPDKs delivered by the foundries and IDMs.

The Titan Mixed-Signal Solution: Integrating Analog and Digital implementation 

Titan is the industry's first platform to truly integrate analog design, digital implementation and verification. With automated mixed-signal assembly and verification, Titan provides an order-of-magnitude productivity improvement over other analog flows. Titan comprises user-friendly full-custom schematic and layout editors, an analog simulation environment, correct-by-design schematic-driven layout (SDL) and integration with Magma tools for simulation and physical verification. It provides a unified mixed-signal design cockpit with very high capacity and a very fast database access mechanism. Titan's analog and special-signal shape-based routing provides speed, repeatability and easy implementation of engineering change orders (ECOs). By fully embedding Magma's TalusÂ® platform, Titan combines the high-level efficiency of Magma's digital implementation tools with full-custom analog design tools.

Titan ADX, an integral part of Magma's Titan mixed-signal design platform, focuses on solving analog/mixed-signal design, optimization and porting challenges. The Titan ADX model-based approach allows circuit optimization and porting in a fraction of the time required by simulation-based techniques. The technology enables product groups to push the design envelope for extreme performance, to center the design for multiple process, voltage and temperature (PVT) corner cases, and to reduce power and jitter. In addition to providing an efficient and predictable method to store analog circuits, Titan ADX reduces design porting time from several weeks to just days.

Re-scheduledâ¬¦
Intel is very excited about this meeting and want more people to fly in to be face to face.  They have asked to move it out to Thursday June 10 to allow them to travel where possible.  This will have many of the technical leads, fellows, and internal CAD teams, so the audience is very technical.  We have given them many high level and detailed level powerpoint presentations, and this is to show them what we have now and roadmap plans, and see the tools in action, and/or overview of other customer success/BM results.
Our biggest competition is SNPS, CDNS, and internal CAD development (make vs. buy).  Their primary pain point is is the Analog/MS productivity area.
We can use this time change to our advantage and ensure our demos are tested and clean.  Probably similar to DAC demos and can also replace the need for private Intel sessions at DAC.

Subject: RE: Microsoft Security Essentials - FREE Download

 

Reminder for anyone that has not done this yet. 

 

Make sure you uninstall Symantec Antivirus as both will not run effectively on the same machine.

 

As you may have heard me state lately, I have been seeing more and more viruses that Symantec Antivirus has not been catching. We tried adapting to Yahoo toolbar with AntiSpy but people are just not taking the time to run it and again are getting viruses.

 

I recently heard of an Antivirus program put out by Microsoft for XP, Vista and Windows 7 platforms.  My testing has determined that at least (4) viruses that were missed by Symantec were caught by MSE (Microsoft Security Essentials.  In fact I have not seen a single virus get past MSE since I switched to it.  I have changed all my corporate images to include the MSE and removed the Symantec Antivirus.

 

I have also put some of the people here in Austin that had gotten viruses over to the new MSE, and again, I have not been made aware of a single virus getting through yet.

 

That being said, I would encourage anyone that wants better protection to follow my suggestions below to switch over to MSE since it is FREE you have nothing to lose.

 

Note: Running two antivirus programs on the same machine can cause them to produce false positives and make both in accurate.

Therefore you need to remove Symantec or any other antivirus program prior to installing MSE.

 

Procedures to Install MSE:

1.       Before starting, close all other programs and sessions as this process will require a reboot later.

2.       Go into Control Panel->Add and remove programs

3.       Remove Symantec Antivirus, version 10 requires and uninstall password of â¬Ssymantecâ¬ý it will ask for a reboot when finished, say NO at this time.

4.       Also uninstall, Symantec Live Update.  It will say all Symantec programs need to be uninstalled first.  Say OK and continue.

5.       Upon completion Reboot, your machine to clear memory and let windows update the registry.

6.       The best way to get the latest version of MSE is to do a Google search on â¬Smicrosoft security essentials downloadâ¬ý and then go to the download site to get the latest version and install it, or click this http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/

 

7.       Upon install, it will update the virus definition files and run a quick scan on your system to make sure you do not have a virus that maybe resident in memory.  Let this complete, takes maybe 10 minutes.

8.       I would also suggest running a FULL System scan as soon as possible when you will not be using your system for about an hour. Maybe at night for the first time to make sure a virus is not hidden somewhere on your system.

9.       I would also suggest you go into the schedule tab, and set it up to run DAILY at a time when you know the system will be powered up and you will not be using your system, maybe during lunch.

 

Additional note:

After it runs the first scan check the details and it will flag Tight VNC as a RAT program.  Just tell it not to do anything with it and it will not check it again.  Same for any other remote software you use.  Just check the details and you can say leave it alone.

 

If you have any questions or need any help contact me.

Thanks

Comments to authors:
  1) Analog placement and routing literature goes back to late 1980s. Please
  make sure to read, understand, and site seminal papers in the area:
  1) Use of annealing for placement
  2) Use of symmetric/performance-driven routing
  3) Handling of latch-up
  4) Analog constraint mapping
  5) Efficient algorithms for diffusion sharing (with symmetry constraints)
  6) Efficient algorithms for wirelength and congestion minimization

  2) The real test for quality layout is not only performance measurable by
  simulation, but, also comparison to manual layout for device matching
  purposes. Please demonstrate how well are the auto-layouts compare vs
  manual layout regarding matching.

  3) The circuits used in experimental results are dominated
  by capacitors, thereby, making the area comparison not very
  meaningful. And yet, there is a lot of wasted area in the shown layouts. 
  
  4) Common centroid not only requires a good placement, but also a good
  symmetric routing. No example is given which shows auto-routing for
  common-centroid symmetry. 

Additional comments for the technical committee (not for authors)
  Practical techniques for analog layout have been available for two
  decades now. Nothing new there. So, that does not look good.

  Further, there is no clear contribution of ideas/algorithms or techniques
  to the state of the art. 

  Add on top, a poor literature survey, (incremental value over incremental
  value, over...) What a waste of energy, time and money. :-(

  But, that's nothing new either :-)

** Devgan on layout automation -- custom layout productivity
   You can trust me on this as the best-in-the-world technical leader and
   project manager... but I need:
   1) committed resources 
   2) commitments from Sumit and Shing-Te... 
   3) few trips to Austin... and maybe even to India...
   4) Don't want to go thru Mar (a big waste of time, technically,
      really. This is layout design, not circuit design cad!).
   5) Realistic expectations if fully staffed: 
      	problem (one week)
	prototype (six months)
	partner (one year)
	product (two years)
