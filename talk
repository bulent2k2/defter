* Layout Migration

* Abstract



* Outline

Stuff, concepts, objectives

- Design, like Life itself, is a sequence of changes
  Figure out what change we want (Book: "Goal")
  Evaluate candidate changes (or else no optimization/synthesis)
  Implement those changes
- Change happens in:
  Circuit
  Layout
  Manufacturing
- Design objects
  Levels of abstraction..
  Sand, Dopants, Insulator, Openings, Cuts, Thin film, tunsten filling, ...
  "Shapes" in mask layout
  Device/pcell/subcell/block/IP/Chip/SOC

Migration := Reuse, recycle with a major twist

VLSI/ASIC revolution happened thanks to an ingenious (and in hindsight obvious)
combination of synthesis (Design Compiler) and reuse (Std cell libraries).

In custom or analog, same thing happens, alas with engineering labor. Intel
employs a team of mask designers as big as SNPS.

Qualcom declared 30x increase in layout labor for tsmc28 (or 20?)

* Summary

* The happy end of the beginning and beginning of the end (:-)
