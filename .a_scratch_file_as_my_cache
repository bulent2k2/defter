- abutment. End of week

1 chain:
mn3.0 mn3.1 mn2 mn0.0 mn1 mn0.1

mn3.0 has 2 fingers. So do mn3.1, mn2 and mn1. 
mn0.0 and mn0.1 each has 1 finger.
- std-part with boundary association - 4 rows.
- CAE for ICF/Altera

We have four nets in a loop: ntop, nright, nbottom, nleft.
m0 and m1 each have 2 fingers.
m2 has a stack of two fingers in series
m3 has a stack of two series of two fingers

  We have min and max width (based on user input). Let's denote them as: w*, W*
  But, we pick w > w* and W < W* to correct for inaccurate computation of TRA.
  So, we have w, wa, wb, W
      where w1 and w2 correspond to two preferred aspect ratios, 1/1 and W/H
  This gives us three intervals: 
    ia = w1 - w
    ib = w2 - w1
    ic = W - w2
  Let's order them as i1 (longest), i2, and i3 (shortest).
  Also, let's denote the mid-points of each of these intervals as w1, w2, w3
  Case N (number of solutions user wants to see) of
    0  -> Nothing to do :-)
    1  -> Use (w1 + w2) / 2
    2  -> Use w1, w2. Denote this as S(2), 
    3  -> Use S(2) UNION {w1}
    4  -> Use S(2) UNION S{w, W}
    5  -> Use S(4) UNION {w1}
    6  -> Use S(5) UNION {w2}
    7  -> Use S(5) UNION {w3}
    8  -> Use S(7) but replace w1 with w1a and w1b
          where w1a and w1b divide i1 into three equal segments
    9  -> Use S(8) but replace w2 with w2a and w2b
    10 -> Use S(9) but replace w3 with w3a and w3b
    11 or more, just subdivide the darn [w, W] interval to N-1 parts! :-)

* 9001054876 CDPV:: fixed manual oaFigGroup location is flexible

As current fixed FigGroup FS, this fixed FG_4 should be treated as fixed "as-is", the location should be fixed in the placment results. But FG_4 location is flexible and that is not expected.

* Meet with Fred:
This afternoon looked much better. Sorry  for the late notice. Please let me know if I need to reserve a room in MV. 

Here are some thoughts..

Layout Editor (manual): Almost there: instance snapping will support placement grids in SP1. But, can be improved to support fig-groups (user or constraint generated). [Meeting minutes Jon/Jingyu/Barry/Bulent]
SDL chaining: Almost there. Multi-row (NPPN and PNNP) support is coming up in SP1. [Shabbir,Bill project id]
SDL matching: Key piece of the puzzle! But, with a few focused enhancements, we can get high mileage. Let’s talk.
AI: Variable row pitch.. -> Ask Bill.. Jimmy’s STAR on variable pitch spacing… instMatching <- UCM.. 
Placement Assistant: Need enhancements to support Rows constraint better.

For 16.06 SP1, we will probably have to limit the scope.
For 17.03, we need a clear scope definition. We probably need to limit the support for multiple track regions: LE to support manual work. But, SDL and  PA need to still focus on single-global track region and support it fully. The user can then do manual floor-planning to put together regions when they interact..
  
17.03 User picks active region/tracks + row configuration…Is it too cumbersome? Ravi T. Layout engineers.. Fred -> Debbie -> Indushekhar.. Not as a batch  tool.. 
Nvidia meeting… Engine only in Virtuoso.. NO. But, steering team is picky.. 

* MCP minutes:

We discussed:
- partial placement and brief comparison of PointArray vs StartLayout params in the schema.
- performance: the need to profile the interface vs the engine. There is an 8x inefficiency in memory/disk-space usage due to duplication for each of the 8 orientations. Further, multiple occurrences are also duplicated instead of referring to the same master. So, for i1,i2,i3 instances of the same master, we get 3*8 DLO instances.
- implicit top structured-partition for designs with many std-cells to be distributed among other custom/analog components

AI: Joe to prepare for a code review on StartLayout, and what object types are supported and how in the interface & engine
AI: Joe to scope direct-OA interface project for future planning: identify and describe major components that need modification, etc.
AI: Varun to prepare for a code review on PointArray

- enhance Rows constraint to input a row configuration (RC) (similar to "row-stack" templates: a list of space/device/tap rows) -> UCM dependency
- enhance Rows to auto-assign components to available rows in the RC
- enhance Rows to be track aware during connectivity minimization

Hi Amrish,

My testing of the package failed . 

It seems that the packager doesn’t create PCX related commands (cnserverctl, cnpxm, etc.) for PyCellStudio.

So, we would need a full Helix package. Please create one and inform us so that package testing can be re-done.

Hi Ming and Amrish,

Here is the summary for this python 262 package testing.

•  Installation testing.  The package is installed both on suse and rehat machines.  There is no issue found.
•  Package files check compared with 2015.09-1 release. There are no changes.
•  OA version and labeling checks.
o   package labeling : K-2015.09-1-T0719 
o   package OA version: 22.50:011
o   Python : 2.6.2 

•  String check are fine.
•  Tutorial lib data run fine.
•  Existing pycellstudio related regressions run well.
•  Doc/pdf files have out-of-date labeling.(Eg: , J-2014.09, I-2013.12), same issue found in 2015.09-1 release.

Hi Ming,

The PCellXtreme code is solely in the Santana module. The helix module just calls some APIs from Santana module for SKILL abutment. 
Those APIs have not changed in any sense. 

So a PyCellStudio package should suffice. But it is your call.

Hi Bulent,
 
I have found the reason for the abutment issue.
Actually this is a regression for us as some existing code was commented in March 2015.
 
This happened during the Maxwell integration phase wherein initially pcellXtreme code from standalone Santana was also integrated in Maxwell. That led to some incorrect compiler warnings and to correct them some working code was commented. The back integration to standalone introduced this issue.
 
Ming,
 
We’ll need to ship a PCX package to Intel with this fix.

How and where customers can upload files to Synopsys (North America server)
Customers should be informed to upload their files to: 
1.	Type the command ftp ftp-na.synopsys.com or the IP address (198.182.61.14) 
2.	SolvNet username and password should be used. 
3.	Type the command cd /pub/incoming 
4.	Type bin command (optional) 
5.	Type hash command (optional) 
6.	Type the command put (filename) to place file in the incoming directory. 
7.	Type quit command to exit 
Note: When the file transfer is completed, the synchronization process will copy the file to the internal FTP system: (us01-ftp-int.synopsys.com). The customer must communicate the filename and transfer status to you once the file transfer is complete. Files on the internal server will be removed after they reach 5 days old.

Hi Rekha,
 
Can we meet at 11am your time? Please send me an invite, if that works.
 
I have some update on contact rings but also Prashant tells me that the log file does not seem to correspond to the abutment issue. So, I would like to reproduce that with you and check the log file again.
 
Cheers,
Bulent

** Unfortunately,  we are not getting enough information from the log files in order to root-cause the PCX issues. 

I would like us to meet with Abhishek and Prashant to help nail down this issue with PCX. They are our experts and live in Noida. 

Can we have a meeting with them early morning your time?

As you probably know, your time zone is half a day away from theirs. So, 9am your time would be  9:30pm theirs. 

Please let us know your availability today or tomorrow morning.

1-	Current commitment for PA (placement assistant), until  17.03, is to support only tech rules for “device placement”. Ming, please confirm. 
2-	(1) means that results in PG (placement gallery) should be correct for fin grid (but, agnostic to track patterns). Glen, please confirm.
3-	In 17.03, PA needs to support NUTP (non-uniform track patterns) as per Track Regions fspec. Do we also want to support UTP (uniform track patterns) for older/planar nodes? Given one design/test-case, only one of them should be active. NUTP does make UTP obsolete. I am not sure what the plans area. Ming, can you please talk to Stan and find out?
4-	I love crappy drawings. They save time and explain things. Thank you, Glen.

* TODO: New STAR:
Top-level with one fixed group and one std-cell constraint creates poor results. This issue was encountered during demo of Std Cell constraint to Jimmy.

Top level has only two components:
1- A fixed column
2- An std-cell constraint

We get four results. 001 and 002 are ok. 000 and 003 are not acceptable.

Hi Mirko,

We need to enhance the engine to compute the bbox of ucells as it is computed by the platform. bbox of a ucell should be computed OR'ing the bbox'es of its components. bbox of an instance is computed using an industry-wide convention/preference order. It is something like the following (please check with platform experts to get the exact spec):

** - Use SnapBoundary, if any
- Otherwise, use PRBoundary, if any
- Otherwise, use bbox of instance,drawing LPP, if any
- Otherwise, use oa.getBbox api

This test-case clearly shows the problem: Top-level has only one component: standardCells1 (ucell1). I modified the pgrid intent on it to clearly show that the bbox of ucell1 is computed using all contents.

** STAR: 9000976845- PNStack to optimize abutment for each "critical" row
PNStack to optimize abutment for the "critical" row
For both the single-row (MaxRows=1) and multi-row cases (MinRows > 1), the user expects the following:
1- The "widest" row (p or n), denoted as the "critical row", must have the "minimum" number of diffusion chains ("chains" in short) so that the area of PNStack is minimized.
2- For all other rows, it is OK to have more than the minimum number of chains so long as the number of CMOS alignments is maximized. (I.e., it is OK to reduce abutment so that alignment is improved, except for the critical row.
3- To maximize CMOS alignment, number of fingers that are aligned must be maximized. Therefore, it is not sufficient to only align the instances. Given MN1 and MP1, with common gate net, e.g., with 2 and 3 fingers each, aligning only one of the fingers would be sub-par.

The following solutions have large wasted space in a number of rows: layout 000, 002, 003.
layout001 (NP.PN.NP.PN.NP) is pretty good. But, removing the last (top-most) p-row would improve the area further.

Hi Xiaodan,

This is not a “bug” but a “feature” .. Seriously, Packed style is a requirement from a customer where they don’t want DRC rules to be used. Instead Xgrid and Ygrid param values are to be provided by the user to align placement of instances on a grid.

Please update those params to a large (multiple of finfet grid pitch) value and re-try.

Bulent

Subject: RE: About track pattern question with 10nm PDK

Hi Xiaodan,

I double checked that a wide alignment constraint is present in the OA tech DB, and it is properly converted into DRC operations for GCP geometry engine.

The problem seems to be specific to Cluster constraint with “Packed” style.
If you change it to any other style - for example, “Normal” - then the fin fet gridding rules are obeyed.

I suggest you open a STAR for this bug.

Hi Ming,

I ran GCP with a simple case that based on reference10nm, but the instances are off FIN grid in placement result. Should I do some extra setting in tech file and so on?

BTW, Helix standalone can handle the FIN grid with AbsoluteReles(true) setting in tech property map file.

* MINUTES:

They liked it overall. 

Attendees: Barry, Fred, John and Bulent
Barry: Can use the "Origin" field/param of insts/fig-groups. 
Jon: The platform needs to support origin better for fig-groups.
Barry/Jon: Track Assistant to have a new tab? Grid Assistant?
Barry: A selected sub-set per design: Allowed p-grids
Barry: No track patterns in tech/design, still get a set of default p-grids
Barry: Auto assignment of decorators to many instances?
Fred: This is done by bottom up construction.. 
Bulent: When there is no routing, user intervention is needed now. Based on size and pin count, we might estimate routing complexity and the number of layers to be used..
Barry: This proposal concerns not only UCM, but also infrastructure and technology groups. They need to be informed. Minutes to be sent to Randy..
Fred/Jon: Also LE needs to be involved to support p-grids
Jon: Check with MSIP whether they would be interested in p-grids.
Fred: Should we go public about it, or keep quiet for now (and leave the other guys behind)?
Fred: Look into scheduling.. Stan have already stated that the team is overbooked.
Jon: Pins/tracks have a dimension based tagging, there is request to have a "strength" field and the tool to do a regex on it.. But, could also be a number (from supply lines)

** 2016.09.12
Overview of the last two weeks

[Intel]
+ NSG: Met with Rekha and helped her clean up the Helix/PCX setup and her work area. Packaged the test-case from Rekha as a tar file and passed on to Prashant to debug the pcell eval/tcl init problem. Also used Virtuoso to bring up HEI and Helix to ensure that CDesigner is not the culprit of some of the problems. Confirmed that we get the same pdk init error.
+ Earlier, found out that there were some missing libraries in Rekha's latest test-case. Requested and received the missing libs. 
+ Later, got a fix from Prashant in Helix code. Also got his help with using his local build. We were able to get a good run for the fairly complex hv_termo_analog circuit. Thanks a lot, Prashant! 
+ It looks like CDesigner has problems with helix debug build. So, I put together and am using two separate setups, one to run CD/HEI and another to run Helix/PCX.
+ Continued testing and hit an issue with cndefls. Packaged the test-case and sent out to Iulian and Glen for further investigation.
+ Rekha reported that she was also able to get more successful runs with the latest/clean setup!

[PGrids]
+ Helped Yakov with snapTarget shape/property in Ellen's test-case (Re: STAR 9001086969)
+ Conversation with Abhishek on Copy Result to help promote p-grids.
+ Conversations with Joe to clarify PGrid anchor concept. Many thanks go to Yakov and Prashant who also provided good detailed info on existing APIs!
+ Got good feedback and some questions from Bill's team. Seems like we now have a shared vision. Responded and also requested that early feedback is provided to the user when she inputs inconsistent data.
+ Investigated STAR: 9001089245. Seems like the input data is inconsistent (between pgrid pitch values and the width/height of the cells). { CDPV:Standard Cells constraint placements are off P-Grid }
+ Investigated and had a follow up discussion in the triage meeting: STAR: 9001091071- CDPV: groups decorated with both p-grid and (guard-ring or routing stripe)

[Reuse/Relative]
+ Discussion with Prashant/Joe/Ming on STAR: 9001082920- Relative intent with hierarchical constraints does not generate correct output
+ Created new STAR: 9001087913- Relative constraint needs Orientation added to the table
+ Created new STAR: 9001090300- Placer to support Relative intent based on UCM table

[MCP-sync]
+ Summarized the results from the latest investigations for PNStack enhancements: signal-flow, routability and area (pin alignment, abutment, channel height). Presented to the team in the sync meeting.
+ 1:1 with Kumar on cost function and annealing.

[Misc.]
+ Various code reviews for Kumar and Brian. Finished all my overdue reviews, too.
+ Completed one of the required classes: Diversity and inclusion
+ Discussion and investigation on 17.03 dependencies

[Plan:]
- Compete the second required course on Confidential Information
+ Req/Proposal for track aware (gridded) device placement. Updated the slides to address all relevant constraints.
+ MCP-sync
+ opampX10 test-case for device-level
+ Met Prashant to discuss device grids (track groups with more than one instance track). If a p-grid has multiple instance tracks, we will translate it as device-grid. The immediate parent UCell is automatically assigned, again by the translator, a block grid that corresponds to the first instance track. As such, the devices will always stay on the appropriate grid. User has the option to override (to make the block grid coarser). So, translator will check for that.
- Watch Jimmy's demo
- Discussion with Prashant on pgrid enhancements
- New release to Intel NSG
+ Met Prashant to discuss things. Longer term items got us excited and could not get to 17.03 :-). Will do that on Monday.
- Work with Kumar to clarify requirements and proposal for routability in row-based designs
- Work with Varun to clarify the rectilinear PRBoundary support for ICF
- Further communication with Jyun-Ze from Bill's (SED) team to refine detailed requirements (watch the SED demos, too!)
- Document user interface enhancements in InstMatching and Rows (internal implementation using PA's VPattern/VMatrix&Row to support row-stack requirements).
- Compile and publish PNStack test-cases and the code to visualize track assignments in CC
- Compile Tcl utilities, unit tests and send out to Brian
- Update the fspec with an overview of p-grid functionality
+ More MCP code review 
+ Investigate STAR: 9001094418. And help Brian add support for stack-mos (| basename delimiter). {Group Devices runtime is much longer and doesn't consider stack mos group.}
+ Two 17.03 planning meetings.
+ ICF meeting. 
+ MCP-sync minutes:
0) Update: team is busy fixing SP1 stars. Sumit is on vacation next week.
1) Brief discussion on STAR {9001089245 CDPV:Standard Cells constraint placements are off P-Grid}. In the test-case, we have an aux-cell (ENDCAP) with width that is not a multiple of x-pitch. The origin of the cells are not on grid. Not a high priority. AI: Bulent/Joe to discuss Joe's concerns with p-grid anchor support.
2) Intel ICF requirement on rectilinear PRBoundary creation. We discussed Laya's slides [ATTACHED], clarified requirements and discussed solution. Helix GUI has "Create Top PRBoundary" parameter with: none/bbox/promote*  options. We need to add a polygon option. AI: Bulent to send out API info from Siarhei.
3) Intel ICF requirement on PNStack enhancement for routability. Clarified that there is no code that does "channel width" estimation as yet. Joe emphasized the need to investigate the quality of the cost function for given optimal layouts and to see why the engine does not produce them. Kumar asked about trade-offs for alignment, optimal chaining and number of routing tracks (trunks). However, there is no easy answer. The customer wants it all: (a) do not miss any alignments (all gates and output node), (b) find the best chaining, (c) should require the minimum number trunks. We need a set of test-cases to cover typical/common circuitry like inv/nand/nor/mux/decoder etc.. AI: Pick a good PDK/test-case in CC and develop and test with CMOS/SED/PNStack in CC as well as Helix standalone.
4) 17.03 Track aware device placement. Discussed requirements & proposal on SED with p-grids; and what this means for the placer.

+ Reviewed p-grid STAR with updated data from Ellen {9001089245 CDPV:Standard Cells constraint placements are off P-Grid}. Some aux cells have off-grid width. Assigned back to Ellen. Also reduced the priority for now.
+ One more code review with Brian


** 2016.08.29

Weekly
======

[Intel]

+ Continued to investigate old PNStack STARs and test-cases. Wrote some code in .py and .tcl to help visualize wiring complexity in CC by implementating the left-edge algorithm. This helps assign trunks to tracks effectively. The key finding is that the connectivity model in the engine, currently, does not represent the main wiring challenges of row-based designs accurately. This is the core impetus behind the "signal flow" requirement from ICF. Will present in mcp-sync meeting.
+ Intel NSG: Reproduced some of the issues reported by Rekha in house. Set up CDesigner (14.12)/HEI and the NSG test-case we received last week. The test-case is missing some symbols and layouts (from two missed libraries). Requested Rekha to send them over, too. However, we can still reproduce some PDK/PCX related issues here. Reported to Prashant to investigate further. Rekha has also reported an issue with cndefls, but, I was able to run it successfully at SNPS. Her issue seems to be specific to her env/lib.defs. I will talk to her, too.
+ Attended weekly ICF/PSG meeting. Communicated our request to re-clarify the top priorities to help us focus, as we have a large number of outstanding issues we have been discussing. Laya has the action item. We also had a couple of discussions on env (custom bashrc) clean-up and tcl error in Helix. Girish did not attend. Had a separate 1:1 with him to discuss and clarify the details regarding pdk auto-init and tcl call-back support in Helix vs CC.

[PGrid]
+ Met with Yakov and helped with CC features and test-cases. Also requested tutorial info from Jimmy who has provided the link to a share-point.
+ Created: STAR: 9001085784- Decorating user fig groups for placement (i.e., Placement Grid decorator). This is now a dependency  of STAR: 9001008931- CDPV: manual group is not placed with placement grid setting.
+ Reviewed the p-grid STAR on Column constraint. Looks good to me. Asked Ellen to check again and close: 9001083115- CDPV:Promoted p-grid with column does not work corretly. However, the one on Rows constraint is confirmed: STAR Number: 9001083084 -- Title: CDPV:Promoted p-grid with row does not work correctly.
+ Provided a description of snapTarget support to Ellen. She tested and filed a star accordingly as our code does not seem to support them yet.

[MCP/Partition/Relative]

+ Held an MCP-coder meeting and sent out the minutes.
+ Did two rounds of code review for Kumar code@3345948 and code@3339130 for STAR 9001077531: Improve results when fixed boundary is specified.". Also had some discussions with Joe on this. Joe has some new recommendation on an alternative and supposedly more natural solution. We need to discuss the specifics further.
+ Investigated Biying's star on relative constraint. Identified various issues. Forwarded to Prashant and Joe. Prashant fixed his part and passed on to Joe. Joe had a question and I responded to him. STAR: 9001082920- Relative intent with hierarchical constraints does not generate correct output

[Misc PA STARs]
+ STAR: 9001067968- {PA batch realizer failed to realize row-column constraints} Reviewed and informed Jui-Hsiang that the behavior is as expected. Also showed how to resolve the DRCs by updating the Separation parameter of the constraints. 
+ Attempted to file a star on Place Selected running on a Cluster of type "packed". Seems to have been fixed as of Thu. Later Joe confirmed that he turned on MT on Wed. I confirmed this by observing multiple threads being consumed by the packed cluster.

[Plan:]
- Put together requirements on PA for Rows/InstMatching to be track aware.
- Review the new p-grid related STARs
- Continue work on performance test with devices
- Review latest demos in core team (and SED demos from Bill!)
- Discuss with Jimmy abutment and interleaving requirements on pattern generation
- Review star from PV Yerevan on performance and discuss with Jimmy to clarify use cases and requirements
- ICF: Discuss priority of Altera issue on StdPart boundary assoc issue. Try old engine. Also try 4 ordered pins on the right edge.. Also check priority/urgency..
- Create another test-case to reproduce another StdPart problem from Girish.
- Intel NSG: provide sample code for custom contact ring
- FILE BUG ON: Enhance PA to run without interconnect layers in tech.
   ~stars/testcases/9001076890/test_instMatch_placementGrid.tgz
- Presentation on algorithmic background and future of PA
  - Add a table of key:Constraint -> value:Algorithms
- Required and overdue Synopsys courses

** 2016.08.22
======
Weekly
======

[Intel]
+ ICF: Had a meeting with Girish and Laya and discussed signal-flow requirements. WIP.
+ ICF: Focused on PNStack enhancements (to address signal flow and abutment requests). Reviewed some of the open stars (there are a total of 28 of them) and will discuss internally. The decoder test-case is a good showcase. But, there are at least a handful of STARs that might be dependencies.
+ ICF: Investigated a star, but, could not reproduce. STAR Number: 9000921140 (Import Floorplan fails when non-existent file included as SOFTINCLUDE). Requested test-case from Laya.
+ NSG: Had a meeting with Rekha after she resolved the issue with Virtuoso access problem. Helped her create a new test library with hierarchical schematics/layouts. We hit bunch of new issues. Met a couple of times. Did not have any luck. Requested a test-case which arrived today. WIP to set things up and re-produce.
+ NSG: Had terminal mismatch problem in the first hier run. Gave instructions on how to relax terminal checking. Helped a bit. 


[PGrid]

+ Put together a hierarchical test-case for Yakov (using soft-macro setting). 
+ Described the new p-grid features for block placement as per Ellen's request and provided a test-case.
+ Reviewed one of the star's from PV. Found out that the origin of all six instances are indeed on grid. Informed Ellen. STAR: 9001083056- CDPV:the placement of macrocells without boundary are out-of Pgrid


[Fix topology]

+ Helped Biying create a 5x bigger test-case. The new Partial Slicing algorithm works very well and fast (despite having n*n*n worst case in theory). Had a 1:1 with her and a wrap-up/summary meeting with Mirko and Ming.
+ Reviewed Biying's code/checkin


[MCP/CMOS/(Packed)Partition]
+ Presented new device-level results from rx_ana. The "Place" command took 26h to run due to a combination of two things: (a) irregular boundary handling, (b) slowness when only one thread is available. Joe is investigating the second which is a bottleneck for all apps of MCP.
+ Did a new PackedPartition run with placement grids.. Used Place Selected as one master still fails in Place. Irregular boundary handling taking too long..
+ Observed that only 1 thread is active. Reported and had some follow up discussion. Will file a STAR on it.
+ Investigated and confirmed new STAR: 9001081697- CDPV: placed devices are out of wide alignment with CMOS constraint.


[CC/UCM]
+ Created a new STAR: 9001082269- Constraint creation commands to register to Command Options/History Bar. Stan set the target release as 17.03.


[Plan:]
- Investigate FinFet boundary support in CMOS and respond to Ellen.
- Review emails from: DRS_DO_NOT_REPLY
- Provide a description of the following problems to Biying (1) global placement for relative clustering, (2) symmetry extraction (see ALX spec)
- Continue to clean up many work areas using very old revisions of contaminated ref10 PDKs
- Help Joe with purify build.. Sym Partition has inconsistent results..

Summary
=======

This report covers the period since 2016.07.30.

In the last two weeks, both Intel ICF and NSG activity (standalone Helix work) picked up. 

I also had a 3-day ETO (Aug 3-5) and a half-day sick leave (son had syncope)


Details
=======

[Intel]
+ NSG: Had two meetings with Rekha. First, we confirmed that the fix release is functional and addresses the abutment problem! (:-) Then, we tried to reproduce the issue with Matrix she reported, but could not. Gave her another intro to constraints: Partition, Matrix, Pattern (failed due to incorrect version of Tcl!) Also helped her with a hierarchical run. The last meeting was interrupted due to an issue with Virtuoso not opening up schematics after deleting layout views. She will report back and we'll continue.
+ Two Intel ICF/PSG sync meeting. Discussed (a) rectilinear PRBoundary generation, (b) Row and PNStack signal flow/max abutment, (c) StdPart boundary assoc. Edge position did not help. Top priority: PNStack signal flow..
+ Helix standalone license issue is resolved - workaround by Mirko, also Keith, Mike, Kervin Chang (SWE). Earlier we could not run helix standalone. Opened a CCT request to renew licenses on bear. 
+ ICF: Laya reported many issues with Pattern editor and RowStack. We requested her to provide details and test-cases. Awaiting.


[Placement Grids]
+ Communicated latest rev of pgrid requirements on SED matching mode to Bill and Shabbir. Also published here: [http://sp-amsg/sites/CustomDesigner/Specs/Requirement/Placement-Grids-Requirements-17-03.pptx]. 
+ Sent a request to Nari and Fred to review SED enhancement proposal for device-level track awarenss using general (non-uniform) placement grid decorators
+ Met with Yakov to review the results on the pgrid origin/promotion test-cases. Top-level works well with origin. However, promotion in constraint hierarchy has issues. Likewise, promotion in cell hierarchy has issues. After his fixes, we met again, and found some other issues with accessing and checking the integrity of the new oa-property.
+ Filed a STAR on CE: STAR: 9001076890- Adding objects to Placement Grid decorator "steals" them from inst Matching


[Performance]
+ Continued work on Performance with device-level test-case from MSIP. Encountered a number of issues. Filed one STAR: 9001079168- "Place Selected" fails on some devices. Will file another soon. Glen addre
ssed the STAR promptly. Attempting to validate with the next nightly, I identified one more problem, re-opened the star and updated the work log. The good news is that I confirmed all the  other masters to work fine.
+ Worked around the issues by encapsulating the failing masters within as-is groups. Got the first run of the large "flattened" design. With 14 components, PackedPartition takes 26 hours to finish! Granted, some components are very large, but, this is still surprisingly slow. Next, I will try regular Partition as well as MCP Partition to compare.


[MCP]
+ Met Kumar and discussed (1) BlockSize support, (2) AspectRatio calculation improvements, (3) Altera STAR: 9001072502.
+ Discussions with Kumar on: 9001077531 NEW E2|Improve results when fixed boundary is specified|Custom Compiler
+ Discussion on default range of aspect ratios.
+ Discussion with Kumar on design for multiple aspect ratios..


[Device grouping]
+ Completed code review for Brian fixing issue with split device support in device grouping (STAR: 9001075311 NEW B3|GCP GroupDevices 'steals' members from existing constraints|Custom Compiler)


[CC Fspecs]
+ Review UCM spec update for 16.06SP1 in DRS (to cover for Ming). 


[Misc]
+ 3 day ETO: Aug 3-5
+ Out half a day on Friday Aug 12th of due to son blacking out. Thanks to 13-1, his injuries are not too bad!



*** AI: Check with Siarhei polygon PRBoundary creation. Finish script only?
*** AI: ICF meeting: Signal flow: do you want option to control? Or change the default result, or multiple candidates to pick from, 
*** AI: Signal flow on PNStack.. Other constraints? Only Row. Anything else? Signal flow or max abutment? Both!
*** ICF:
Amrish to attend or not?
Option in case there is a trade-off.
Multiple PNStacks in a column?
Alternatives?
First group P and N based on signal flow and from the same gate..
The current solution is bad, so option is not needed..
Laya to send out slides on signal flow on other constraints
AI: Send out STARs on four issues.. (2 old + 2 new)
AI: Import floor-plan
AI: Slides on expectation/requirements/sample test-case
Girish: Stack mos legs to stay together (don't interleave)

(:-) Then, we tried to reproduce the issue with Matrix she reported, but could not. Gave her another intro to constraints: Partition, Matrix, Pattern (failed due to incorrect version of Tcl!) Also helped her with a hierarchical run. The last meeting was interrupted due to an issue with Virtuoso not opening up schematics after deleting layout views. She will report back and we'll continue.
+ Two Intel ICF/PSG sync meeting. Discussed (a) rectilinear PRBoundary generation, (b) Row and PNStack signal flow/max abutment, (c) StdPart boundary assoc. Edge position did not help. Top priority: PNStack signal flow..
+ Helix standalone license issue is resolved - workaround by Mirko, also Keith, Mike, Kervin Chang (SWE). Earlier we could not run helix standalone. Opened a CCT request to renew licenses on bear. 
+ ICF: Laya reported many issues with Pattern editor and RowStack. We requested her to provide details and test-cases. Awaiting.


[Placement Grids]
+ Communicated latest rev of p-grid requirements on SED matching mode to Bill and Shabbir. Also published here: [http://sp-amsg/sites/CustomDesigner/Specs/Requirement/Placement-Grids-Requirements-17-03.pptx]. 
+ Sent a request to Nari and Fred to review SED enhancement proposal for device-level track awareness using general (non-uniform) placement grid decorators
+ Met with Yakov to review the results on the p-grid origin/promotion test-cases. Top-level works well with origin. However, promotion in constraint hierarchy has issues. Likewise, promotion in cell hierarchy has issues. After his fixes, we met again, and found some other issues with accessing and checking the integrity of the new oa-property.
+ Filed a STAR on CE: STAR: 9001076890- Adding objects to Placement Grid decorator "steals" them from inst Matching


[Performance]
+ Continued work on Performance with device-level test-case from MSIP. Encountered a number of issues. Filed one STAR: 9001079168- "Place Selected" fails on some devices. Will file another soon. Glen addressed the STAR promptly. Attempting to validate with the next nightly, I identified one more problem, re-opened the star and updated the work log. The good news is that I confirmed all the  other masters to work fine.
+ Worked around the issues by encapsulating the failing masters within as-is groups. Got the first run of the large "flattened" design. With 14 components, PackedPartition takes 26 hours to finish! Granted, some components are very large, but, this is still surprisingly slow. Next, I will try regular Partition as well as MCP Partition to compare.


[MCP]
+ Met Kumar and discussed (1) BlockSize support, (2) AspectRatio calculation improvements, (3) Altera STAR: 9001072502.
+ Discussions with Kumar on: 9001077531 Improve results when fixed boundary is specified
+ Discussion on default range of aspect ratios.
+ Discussion with Kumar on design for multiple aspect ratios..


[Device grouping]
+ Completed code review for Brian fixing issue with split device support in device grouping (STAR: 9001075311 GCP GroupDevices 'steals' members from existing constraints)


[CC Fspecs]
+ Review UCM spec update for 16.06SP1 in DRS (to cover for Ming). 


[Misc]
+ 3 day ETO: Aug 3-5
+ Out half a day on Friday Aug 12th due to son blacking out.

This report covers the period since 2016.07.19.

Intel NSG/ICF/PSG; track-awareness/placement-grid; 3-day ETO.

Details
=======

[Intel NSG] 

+ Used RDS to deliver the Helix package (2015.09-1.T727_py262) to Intel NSG. It should address the PCX abutment issue they've observed. Just got confirmation from Rekha that she received the auto email from RDS. Thanks to Prashant, Amrish and Ellen for their help!
+ Earlier verified the Helix package with Intel's data to confirm that PCX server comes up and evaluates abutted pcells.  
+ Earlier, attempted to verify the new PyCell package. After setting up PCX with Prashant's help, we realized that PyCell studio does NOT have PCX! Now, we know that PCX is delivered only as part of Helix package. With hindsight, that does make some sense.

[Intel ICF/PSG] 

+ We had our weekly meeting with both Girish and Indushekhar in attendance. 
+ Girish reported two issues on Helix. I reproduced in SNPS and filed two STARs:
  . STAR: 9001072554- Row auto-reorder fails to find a 1-chain solution
  . STAR: 9001072502- StructuredPartition boundary association is ineffective in some cases
+ Had a 1:1 with Girish. He reported two issues with StdPart. We've addressed one of them by clarifying the behavior when all insts are 2x. 
+ Reviewed the high-priority issues reported by Intel ICF. 

[PGrid]

+ Put together a few slides to clarify 17.03 requirements on SED matching mode. Will communicate to Bill's and Shabbir's teams next week.
+ Had a 1:1 with Yakov to help explain the test-cases and the results expected. We will have another one later today to look at the results after Yakov's fixes.
+ Had a 1:1 with Girish and discussed requirements and proposal on SED to support RowStack methodology.

[Other]

+ We had an mcp sync meeting and discussed various topics and updates.
+ As per Glen's request, investigated "Group Devices" command. Ran some tests. It does filter out constrained devices. His test-case may have a basename/flat name issue due to recent SDL/UCM changes. 
+ As per Barry's request, packaged and sent out a test-case for Std Cell constraint with aux-cell param setting.
+ Had a 1:1 with Biying and discussed various topics: symmetry, implicit top partition, etc..

[Plan]
- 3 day ETO: Aug 3-5
- Meet with Yakov to review the results on the pgrid origin/promotion test-cases
- Communicate latest rev of pgrid requirements on SED matching mode. 
- Put together requirements on PA for Rows/InstMatching to be track aware.
- Provide a description of the following problems to Biying (1) global placement for relative clustering, (2) symmetry extraction (see ALX spec)
- File a STAR on CE inst-matching. Reminder to Barry..

Details
=======

[Intel] 
+ ICF meeting got rescheduled so that Girish and Indushekhar are both able to attend. We will have the first all-hands meeting later this week. 
+ Had a discussion with Girish regarding strategies on how to evaluate CC in Altera/Intel.
+ Laya reported an issue with HxTech. Seems to be a lib.defs error. Waiting to hear back.
+ We have a fix for the NSG abutment issue. Thanks to Prashant. Amrish is now working on a new package.

[CC17.03] Track awareness/P-Grids
+ Prepared slides on device-level placement in CC: SED/UCM/Platform for track/tile awareness. Set up a meeting and presented the requirements/proposal to Jon, Shabbir and Bill and their teams. Barry couldn't attend. Later, as per my action item, put together a test-case for Inst Matching with a basic non-uniform placement-grid decorator. Along that path, encountered an issue with UCM/CE. Informed Barry. Need to follow up for a resolution.
+ Put together a test-case with three variants to help Yakov test his code for new pgrid development: promotion for constraint/cell hierarchy and origin/anchor support.
+ Earlier had a 1:1 meeting with Barry to evaluate our options for "Row Stack" representation in UCM. He helped ask some good questions..

[CC17.03] Performance/exploration flow/ease of use
+ Working on a performance test with devices. Hit some issues with copy back (taking too long and not copying the correct variant) and had to scale back to a smaller test-case. Work in progress.
+ Also continued adding more content to the presentation on algorithmic background and future of PA. Need to continue and refine..

[Misc.]
+ Had an MCP-sync meeting (July 5) and discussed (a) Area estimation work by Kumar, (b) Performance related plans/slides.

This report covers the period since 2016.06.06.
 
Intel ICF, various Custom Compiler projects and 6 days of ETO (trip to Hawaii :-) 

Details
=======

[Intel]
+ Had a number of discussions and debugging sessions with Laya and Sasank. Many problems were due to minor mistakes in how Intel folks integrated the new code and due to lack of basic unit testing in their environment. The slowness also was a major handicap. But, the good news is that we root-caused and fixed all the issues.
+ ICF: Switching to new License server at Intel resolved the issue. Closed the Case: 8000914781- Helix is too slow - unacceptable execution/GUI launching time
+ Meeting with Indu and Laya. Communicated that they need to contact Anoop and Debbie.
+ Had a hand-on session with Laya to help her with using/testing Packed Partition.
+ Did more testing of the new finish script/A-B-legalizer in berry. Hit a crash in with(DLO), but worked around it. 
+ Got RUNDA and soon after a test-case from Intel NSG. We will debug in a week or two, hopefully.

[CC16.06SP1]
+ Fruitful conversations with Kumar on area estimation given ambivalent user requirements in presence of a PRBoundary or width/height input
+ More discussion with Joe/Kumar on lack of enough solutions when large PRBoundary is given.
+ 1:1 w/ Varun. Did code review of PartialArray, the solution for PrBoundary/width/height/aspect-ratio control for Place and  Place Selected commands.
+ Gave a quick overview of scalable placement problem, too, to Varun.
+ Discussed PRBoundary support during our MCP sync meetings.
+ 1:1 conversations with Prashant and Yakov. We've nailed down all remaining questions on p-grid anchor and promotion (through cell hierarchy).
+ With Biying, clarified requirements, the value of slicing (Rows/Columns), use of both Cluster and Relative constraints for non-slicing (Cluster to improve area, and Relative to "Fix Topology"). Also gave a walkthru on symmetry/fix-group support in Cluster/Top-level, and described how similar code would help translate Relative constraint, too.

[CC17.03]
+ Had a discussion with Fred re: track-aware device placement plans/priorities
+ Put together about 10 slides to outline algorithmic overview. Gave a dry run to some team members including Sumit. 
+ Performance experiments. Got a new large test-case from MSIP (from Shabbir and Subbu). Failed in Placer. Filed new star:
  STAR: 9001062030- Place Selected gives "no sdl session" error, but SDL pick and place works
  Created a test-case myself with 320 instances and have been running a number of experiments. In the meantime, hit a crash in UCM tcl API, but it was due to wrong usage. Will file it ASAP.
+ Discussed Relative constraint during our MCP sync meetings.
+ Attended N7/N10 Advanced Node Meetings

[Plan]
- Test-case to Bill for Inst Matching with p-grid decorator
- Hierarchical (cell hier) test case for new pgrid development as per Yakov's request

Intel ICF and various Custom Compiler projects

Details
=======

[Intel]

+ Laya reported that the MIP showstopper is successfully addressed thanks to the new legalizer code for finish script. The MIP designer saw good results on his design. But, Laya mentioned that her tests had some issues.  She has the action item to send me more details (or setup a debug session), so we can address them.

+ Updated most of the ICF dashboard items (top-priority and top-importance) to reflect my view on the readiness of CC vs Helix.

+ Compiled and sent out info to Laya on rectilinear packing (Using PackedPartition) in Helix as per my Action Item.

+ ICF weekly sync meeting with Laya and Harish.


[CC]

+ Worked on flushing out second order of details for track=aware device placement in PA, SED and platform. Had a conversation with Shabbir on current plans (for SP1). Work in progress.

+ More conversations and a meeting with Barry on Relative constraint usage and requirements. Described our intent to use it as part of the new "Reuse Topology" cmd/solution. There is good consensus and we agreed on two action items: (1) a tcl cmd is needed and (2) orientation needs to be added to bboxes. STAR is filed for (1): {9001054512 Need cm::createRelative Tcl command}

+ Reviewed and approved IFS-API change to support deDecoratorGroup (a sibling  of lePlacementGroup)

+ Reviewed and recommended the closure of: {STAR: 9001026030- CDPV:placer generates incomplete_layout views}

+ Reviewed and re-assigned to Yakov: {STAR: 9001010332- CDPV: constraint group with enclose decorator is placed out of placement grid}

+ Investigated and reassigned two other STARs: {9001010253- CDPV: prboundary is not placed on placement grid} and {9001048634- CDPV: prbounday is ignored when it's greater/less then all instances/shapes bbox}

+ Created an StdCell test-case with 300 instances to help Joe develop/test MT code. It takes about 15 minutes, but upon monitoring with 'top' observed CPU load up to 1000% and around 16 gcp executables. Joe tells me that his MT code is not in yet, so, this is a little bit of a mystery. One culprit is the parallelization in Helix input and output. Will wait to hear from Joe before investigating further, if needed.

+ Had another MCP sync meeting and discussed various mid- and long- term action items. 

+ Had the first of our weekly 1:1 meetings with Biying and helped ramp her up on various fronts (synmake, runBuild, code structure, tcl development tricks, etc.)

+ 1:3 with Biying, Mirko and Ming


[Plan]

- Intel ICF: work on various AIs I own
- Intel ICF: test the new code on new test-case from Laya
- Intel NSG: provide sample code for custom contact ring
- Discuss with Bill re: track-awareness in SED/matching mode

+ Other

Details
=======

[Intel ICF]

+ Re-implemented the A-B grid legalizer routine to address three issues: 1) Enhance to use an env var to provide std-cell lib names instead of the hard-coding in the old implementation, 2) Fix bug that missed flip opportunities (actually all flips!), 3) Don't swap cells for bussed instances. Sent out the first version on Thursday. Got a test-case from Sasank and upon testing found and fixed various bugs. Sent out a revision on Friday. Waiting to hear from Laya. 

+ In the meantime, Amrish was added to the RUNDA (as of Monday). He can help take over the code. I will meet with him and ramp him up.

+ Earlier, met with Laya who informed me that the finish script issue was escalated to a showstopper. Then, we had a 2:1 meeting with Sasank, the end user and debugged the problem. It turned out that the original code had some basic bugs which missed all flips, hence the work reported above.

+ Prepared a short list of open Helix enhancements requested by ICF for Nishath


[Intel NSG]

+ Had a joint session with Rekha and Prashant in order to debug the abutment failure. Did not have much progress. Requested the test-case. They are now in the process of adding us to the RUNDA.


[CC Misc.]

+ Met Jon, Barry, Bing, Jing Yu and Samuel to discuss instance snapping with p-grids. Jing Yu's team is busy with MTK support and they are pushing out full p-grid support to 17.03SP1. But, they will provide some basic support for instance snapping.

+ Had two MCP sync meetings and discussed among other things the support for the new relative intent, soft-groups, performance, interfacing options, etc.. 

+ Met with Yakov to nail down some more details to complete the requirements specification and the core design of origin/snapTarget/prBoundary/anchor support.

+ Attended the N7/N10 Adv Node Meeting. Suggested to improve the name of the new rule. Approved and  improved further by Nari.

+ Met patent attorney to help him understand the invention on placement grids. Also read the revision the attorney sent out after our meeting and did a few more revisions on it.

[Placement grids and tracks]

+ Had a number of long and fruitful meetings and conversations with Yakov and Prashant to clarify various concepts and  requirements: anchor, origin, snapTarget, etc.
+ Had a conversation with Jon to clarify snapTrackPatterns param support relating to placement grids. We will meet with Barry, Bing and Samuel later this week to discuss further.
+ Compiled a list of high-level tasks for track-aware device placement. Responded to a few questions from Ming. Requires more investigation and lower-level details.


[Intel NSG]

+ Continued to work on setup issues. PCX issues are finally fully resolved on Thursday thanks to a joint session with Prashant/Abhishek. Switched to single-user mode. Worked! Also, fixed issue with large-scale mode. It was probably due to a port conflict. On friday, had another meeting  with Rekha to confirm that things are still working.
+ Afterwards, provided a high-level overview and demo of Helix constraints using her test-casea. Unfortunately, neither abutment (in Row) nor Contact Ring constraint worked. Fortunately, many other things do work now. The debug files don't seem to provide enough info on the abutment issue. Needs further debugging.


[Intel ICF]

+ Updated Laya about Amrish coming on board. Requested a RUNDA for him. Received a spreadsheet/dashboard (more than  100 items!) and a request from ICF to mark it w.r.t. CC/PA status on each item.


[MCP sync]

+ Started weekly MCP sync meetings. Collected some relevant papers and sent them out to some team members. Got some questions from Nishath, about which I had a brief converstion with Yakov and responded back to Nishath.
+ Did a brief code review for Kumar's MLK fix


[Other]

+ Had a conversation with Barry on the new Relative constraint. Explained the details to some team members.
+ Responded to questions and  revision  requests from patent attorney. Will meet him to help him understand the invention on placement grids.

[Intel ICF]

+ Reconvened for the weekly status meeting after a three week hiatus. Discussed shorts-checker requirement which segued into requirements on CC. Indushekhar's team is very interested in getting their hands on the latest build of CC to provide their input on PA as well as the platform. Communicated to Nishath. I am still waiting on the meeting minutes as I have a number of action items I need to follow. File some enhancement STARs and communicate plans on engagement, etc..
+ Worked on the enhancement on legalizer for A-B grid issues. Put together a few slides to clarify the problem and the requirements: how to align track patterns for two vertical layers within standard cells. We need to handle (1) swapping of equivalent master cells, (2) horizontal flipping of off-grid instances. Awaiting the promised test-case in berryfarm from Laya. Started coding.

[Intel  NSG]

+ Many Skype meetings with Rekha. We are making daily progress. Also got help from Prashant regarding PCX setup and debugging. The first PCX setup failed with error: PCX server setup configuration file had a parse error. Fixed that. But, still not fully functional. We'll continue to debug this week. In parallel, worked on tech-lib setup. Created a Helix-tech lib and attached maps. OA tech-lib attachment failed. The environment seems to have a different way of doing that. Rekha will work on it.

+ Investigated STAR 9001038774. It is a case of mixing of p-grids with devices. Not a bug. Informed Ellen that it can be closed. {Title: CDPV: copy back is out of placement Grid}
+ Investigated a number of STARs Glen is working on and attempted to clarify requirements and explain observed behavior in le::move, Place* and Copy Results commands. Helped Glen with track pattern  assistant vs track region assistant  and snap-target concepts. Jon also sent a number of issues he's observed with the test-case and current implementation. STARs: 9001029651, 9001042251, 9001043349, 9001043215.
+ Sent out an email to Mirko, Prashant et al to provide some more details on the next phase of development. The focus is on the "origin" problem. The constraint engines need to know the origin and transformation  of each component in the input (cell or group-cell). My understanding  is that DLO does not provide this API. Hence, the need for enhancement. Will discuss further with Prashant. Once origin support is added, the rest of it will be handled within engines and is a low hanging fruit.

[Run-time Performance]

+ Investigated STAR 9001044665. It takes more than 10 min running placer on a two-input nand (or nor) gate with  four schematic instances. Reproduced the problem. Observed that the layout view has 800 devices. Ran the new Group Devices command. This  should improve the runtime drastically, however, a ranked STAR needs to be fixed first. Also experimented with turning off lxSplit parameter and then  it ran in less than a minute. Discussed with Jimmy and he provided some more comments with promise to clarify requirements further.
+ Responded to various questions on performance and QoR profile of PNStack vs SED.

[Split instances]

+ Had a conversation with Prashant and Barry on the split instance proposal and tried to clarify it. Did a little investigation in CC to understand existing behavior of lxSplit and lxExpandMFactor combos. Waiting to hear further on it from Barry or SDL folks.

[Others]

+ Received a new laptop due to refresh and now migrating to it. Did some data transfer and re-install of some of my favorite apps.

[Plan] 

- Intel NSG:  Continue to work on setup issues. PCX then PCell wrapping
- Intel ICF:  Continue to work on enhancements to legalizer. Also, send out a cheat-sheet for python development in Helix
- Finish doing the current revision to the patent write-up and send out to the lawyer
- Investigate further Fin-FET/track pattern conflict. Test track patterns on instance layer.
- Flush out second order of details for device placement in PA, SED and platform
- Read up on the new Relative and Template constraints in UCM
- Prepare presentation to help review methods/algorithms(and new prototype for fast-exploration mode) in PA
- Testing and prototyping for top-level performance for various use cases
- Complete laptop migration
- File overdue expense reports
- Check in a new test-case on auto-grouping (low priority)
- Continue required but overdue courses

** 2016.05.09
This report summarizes the period from 4/25 to 5/9.
 
Summary:
+ Put together and presented "Device placement with track awareness". Also prepared and gave a demo on RowStack.
+ Trip to MV (May 2-4). Attended many presentations/discussions
+ Intel ICF - Met Laya to discuss latest requests from Sasank.
+ Intel NSG - Met Rakhu and Manju to debug setup issue. Sent them an updated PCX cheat-sheet.
+ Compiled a list of dependencies for 16.06SP1 and 17.03.

Details:
+ Slides are in {http://sp-amsg/sites/CustomDesigner/Initatives/physical_automation/Shared%20Documents/Onsite%20May%202016/Device%20Placement%20with%20Awareness.pptx}
+ Two remaining STARs under my name
+ Re-golden two failures due to my check-in
+ Conversation with Prashant/Mirko/Barry on split-instance proposal for stack devices and more
+ A couple of code reviews (from Joe/Prashant)
+ STAR: {9001042559 {CDPV:: "AutoGroup" creates invalid constraint member for split instances}}
  -> Created new STAR: {9001043508 {Select in Design cmd does not work with basename of devices in constraint}}
+ Meet Intel NSG to debug why device layout has overlaps. Found out that their pcx setup was incomplete. Provided them more info in a cheat-sheet. Nobody reads user guides! (:-)
+ Updated and publish p-grid slides with hyperlinks to references (http://sp-amsg/sites/CustomDesigner/Specs/Requirement/Placement-Grids-Requirements-16%2006-Track-Pattern-Support.pptx)
+ Investigated, commented on and re-assigned to Ellen: STAR: 9000993023- CDPV:: CMOS gatealignment issue with splited devices. 
+ Reproduced, investigated and re-assigned to Prashant: STAR: 9000974436. Changed title from: "Issues in "as-is" figGroup identification method" to "abutment fails for Inst Matching"
  Also looked into CNI_AEWARE_DIR env var used by reference40nm in the test-case for STAR 9000974436. This is one suspect for the error reported: 'invalid command name "ref40_abutor"
      while executing
  "ref40_abutor $abutter $abuttee $abutterPin $abutteePin $abutDir $externalConnection 2"'. (ABUTMENT-001)

+ Trip to MV
+ 3-day ETO (April 7th, 8th and 11th)

Intel
=====
Met Sasank from Intel MIP (Oregon, US) to discuss his issue with StdPart
abutment and A-B grids. It looks like he needs an enhancement to the
legalizer code in Finish script. Will discuss further with Laya tomorrow.

ICF requested to find out about shorts-checker support in Helix. Had a good
discussion with Oleg (cnhxlvs won't help, but in principle we can support
it) and will communicate to them on Wednesday. 

Met two members of a new group at Intel (NSG) in Folsom, CA, looking into
Helix for floor-plan exploration. Compiled a set of documents as well as a
working sample test-case and sent out a tar-file. Met them again today to help 
debug issues with HEI setup. Later compiled a cheat-sheet on PCX setup and
sent it to them (too bad my samsung secure disk access is removed :-( and I
could not access the PCX setup I put together about a year ago). 

16.06
=====
A new file (grouping.tcl) is now checked in under src/lp_commands/etc
(thanks to Glen for pointing out the right module). Also modified startup,
menus and actions files to hook things up. Got familiar with p4 (again!)
and runbuild configurations (thanks to Iulian for quick help!). Next, need
to re-golden one (or two?) failing tests, and check-in a new test-case to
validate that the functionality works.

Worked on the other six 16.06 STARs assigned to my name. There are now only
two left. 

Provided requirements to Kumar on bus I/O placement: STAR 9000965453: Bus
terminal pins are not created in sequence. 

Prepared a demo for Jimmy on StdCell placement. Encountered issues. Filed
four new stars:
  STAR: 9001032057- std-cell results are missing 1-row and 3-row solutions
  STAR: 9001037167- top-level with two components (one fixed, one std-cell) results in wasted area
  STAR: 9001037170- copy result cmd moves locked group
  STAR: 9001037216- incorrect messages mentioning symmetry groups and symmetry clusters

Misc.
=====
Prepared slides on PGrid and presented to team.

Had some discussions with Barry and Jon on decorator management. The suggestion
is to work on a new deDecorator (fig-group) object post 16.06.

Responded over email to Siarhei's question on p-grid "snap-origin".

Respond to lawyer's questions and feedback on the patent write-up

Plan:
=====
1st priority: PGrid: PGrid next-phase... Jon Bendickson/Randy.. SED/IFS/..  16.01 -> 16.06.    SP1, SP2.. 17.03 16.09?   Finish planning by end of May.

Summary:

[+] Major focus areas: Intel ICF, various STARs and patent review

Intel ICF:
[+] We have a new time-slot for weekly meetings and we got started on Wednesday! Lyndon was also in attendance.
[+] Laya gave an update, good news and brought up one new issue. A new group at Intel is exploring Helix. However, they have two libraries with copies of both sch and lay views and they need a way to get sch from one and lay from another. With hints from Iulian, Glen, Mirko and Ming, explored a possible solution. Put together a test-case to emulate the requirement. It seems to work fine. Informed Laya with detailed illustrated description of how to set things up to meet the requirement. She will try it out and let us know.
[+] We had a discussion on the oaVia (custom) binding issue (via's guessed to be created by SBR) the problem with the workaround used by the user. Communicated that various workarounds (like using simplistic abstract views) have various issues/limitations. We need to root-cause the main issue and hopefully address it. Prashant will help debug this week.
[+] Mayank brought up a new enhancement request. They are asking whether Helix pin placer can create  multiple shapes for each power pin according to the repeated track pattern. We had an internal discussion with Kumar to follow up. We will discuss the details in this week's sync meeting.

STARs:
[+] As requested by Ming, I investigated 5 critical stars gating PV's work. They are now either fixed or actively worked on.
[+] A STAR from CDPV gave us a hard time this week: 9001024513. At first, the ENV var to switch to old constraint compiler got in the way. Thanks to Iulian for pointing out that the new compiler is already ahead of the old one and has some enhancements that are required by this STAR. Next, I stumbled upon a problem with "as-is" fig-group causing a similar misbehavior. Thanks to Prashant for pointing that out! Please see the bullet below for more details. Going back to the original STAR, it seems to be a similar problem to some other STARs Varun fixed recently. I reproduced it with the latest build, and provided a new test-case to help, and re-assigned to him. Thanks in advance, Varun!
[+] Investigated, reproduced and re-assigned: 9001024517 CDPV:: PNstack cannot be created from 
[+] Validated fix by Varun: STAR: 9001020265- CDPV: placement result is not expected when prbounday is pre-existing

MCP:Partition/PNStack--CC:Cluster/CMOS:
[+] Had a discussion with Joe on supporting single component run with Partition with or without boundary constraint.
[+] Wrote an email to Mirko and other team-members to clarify predicates that necessitate an implicit top-level partition.

PGrid:
[+] Had a brief conversation with Prashant regarding a new STAR and clarified semantics/promotion of decoration on masters.
[+] Reminded Barry regarding the decorator grouping request. Hope to have an update this week before my ETO. 
[+] Created some slides to highlight the challenges of the next phase in p-grid solution. 

As-Is Groups/Copy Results:
[+] Encountered during STAR investigation two issues with "Copy Results" command relating to as-is groups: (1) In different states, it behaves differently which is a source of confusion. (2) As-is groups are identified by one or more fixed components in a "normal" fig-group. CR does switch a group from free to as-is by using this trick only in some cases as pointed out by (1), but, it does it by modifying only one component, but, not all. I think we need to review this and find a way to improve use-model and ease of use. I wrote an email to discuss further, but we probably need to discuss further in a meeting.

CC/Misc.:
[+] Completed patent application and submitted to Anaqua. Got some questions and feedback from the lawyer and responding with more write-up, pictures, etc..
[+] For custom compiler (CC), investigated the sparse build create_tclIndex problem. Came up with a workaround that can be used by the developers and emailed cd-rd. Attempted to fix Synmake in my local build, but encountered an issue trying to build it. Asked Mike for help, but no response so far.

TODO: copy back has issues. Copy back one then switch to the other.. Use the original data from PV test-case: ~/p/star/maxwell/stdcell/9001010191.tar.gz

New- File a STAR: Enhance GCP engine to give warning and handle unbound vias/instances
- Discuss further with Ming and file STARs to track as-is group inconsistencies as needed.
- Slides on proposal.. p-grid phase 2. Decorators..
- Slides for off-site team meeting on placement grids and RowStack
- ETO on Thu, Fri and Mon: 7th, 8th and 11th (spring break :-)
- 924834 UCM STAR on figGroup origin
- Address pgrid promotion across hierarchy
- Auto pgrid definition/decoration
- Origin/snapTarget handling
- Investigate how to productize auto-grouping (HFL--) functionality
- Row-stack plans for 17.03
- Required courses

Summary:
[+] Mostly busy with Intel ICF support and completing the long form write up for the first patent application. 

Intel:
[+] ICF support. There is a new user in Oregon (MIP team) ramping up on Helix and he has various issues. Had a few meetings with him. The workaround for oaVia binding issue has other issues. Looking into it. Got suspended due to Holi last week. 
[+] Had some discussions and questions on odd/even grids. On GNAC (antenna protection diode) instances to protect some gates. Also on how to handle sub-blocks without layout (but with multiple occurrences) from StructuredPartition.. Gave some suggestions.. 

STARs:
[+] Validated the fix for STAR: 9001019953- Crash in DN (sdl_browser)
[+] Updates and discussion (see below) on STAR: 9001019753 CDPV: symmetric decorator is ignored in partition constraint
[+] Conversation on STAR: 9000957761- PRBoundary and Blockage shapes in reference LCV to be honored.
[+] After my input, Xiaodan closed STAR: 9001020702- CDPV:: ref10 PNstack gates do not align

Symmetry decorators:
[+] Answered Ellen's question to clarify symmetry usage. Identified a few symmetry decorator exceptions to handle. Otherwise harder to understand and use. Informed Prashant.

+ Did some testing with p-grid on top-design. Hit the same crash as above.
+ Packaged and sent out a basic p-grid test case with tcl code to Ellen and Kumar. 
+ Answered Ellen's questions on p-grid functionality.
+ Had a brief conversation with Barry and Jimmy regarding inconsistent capitalization of pgrid intent name. Barry will take care of it. Thanks!
+ Had a conversation with Prashant on various second order issues with pgrid functionality. Thanks for quick response!

Intel MIP/PNStack/CMOS:
+ Got RUNDA for 10nm base-layer access. Just in time before the visit to Intel :-). I tried an existing test-case in berry. After some tinkering with the setup/lib.defs, I was able to bring it up with Maxwell/HEI/Helix stand-alone and three run RowStack test-cases. 
+ Verified Joe's recent fix for 9000971713. Various major issues (DRCs/bad-abutments/pitch-errors) are fixed. Wasted area issue is still open (but had some improvement). A new issue: two P-rows are partially overlapped and use less height. This is not acceptable for std-cell place&route, reopened the STAR with lower priority [9000971713 PNStack multi-row with dynamic alignment has illegal overlap and grid violations|Intel|Helix]

STARs:
+ Reviewed the MPP test-case for STAR: 9001001616. Modified the test-case to also test MCP. Got a crash. Filed a new STAR 9001008780- Cluster (mcp) crashes on design with MPP [9001001616 CDPV: placer errors with edit-pcell MPP].

Summary:
    [+] Intel MIP: Reproduced in berry new MIP issues reported by Girish
    [+] PGrid: Team had good progress on all fronts
    [+] Other

Details
=======

Intel MIP/CMOS/PNSTACK
----------------------
+ MIP: Girish reported issues from MIP. At the moment, there is no test case from MIP. I looked into test-cases from older STARs in berry. Reopened one as it reproduces various MIP issues:
  STAR: 9000971713- PNStack multi-row with dynamic alignment has illegal overlap and grid violations
+ Also created a new enhancement STAR:
  STAR: 9001003969- Enhance multi-row PNStack to balance row widths so that total area is minimized

pGrid
-----
+ Clarified "snap-origin", bbox and flip questions with various conversations/emails.
+ Tested std-part with A/B grids. StdPart worked on the tiny test case. However, failed to find a 1-row solution. Reported.
  STAR: 9001003293- StdCell constraint fails when number of rows is set to 1
+ Also encountered frequent crashes during UCM GUI apply command. Reported: 
  STAR: 9001003212- Crash in UCM GUI when applying changes -- after renaming a placement grid
+ Worked with Yakov to test new p-grid support on the new test-case, bring it up in Maxwell, go over full flow (sch->sdl->ucm->gcp->view/copy results), helped with Maxwell commands/key bindings, etc.
+ Enhance TCL API to create multiple uniform grids per direction
+ Provided to Yakov a basic Partition test-case
+ Requested an internal switch to control MCP/SEEKER testing/demo. Thanks to Prashant for quick help!
+ Talked with Fred re: Altera requirements on snapTarget support. His recommendation is to get more input from Intel and Altera before going forward with further work. 
+ Had some discussions on copy-back command supporting p-grids. My recommendation is to re-use the upcoming instance snapping API from the LE. 

figGroups
---------
+ Looked into another issue reported by Mirko with "flexible"/fixed groups. Reproduced the issue. Turns out to be a bug as well as a new requirement, I think. Drafted an initial doc in:
  STAR: 9001002557- Mixed fixed/flexible groups are not handled properly. 
+ Discussion with Joe on fixed/overlapped groups

other
-----
+ Jimmy's presentation and demo

** 2016.02.01
Summary:
    [+] Intel MIP: Had a meeting with Indushekhar's team and MIP folks at Intel. Clarified the status, identified short-term focus to evaluate the latest signal-flow improvements, and longer-term engagement to improve QOR.
    [+] PGrid: Created a stem test-case that can be easily transformed into various test-cases. Also created a simple tcl API to create a uniform pgrid using global track region API. 
    [+] Looked into the flexible fig-group issue reported by Mirko. Worked as expected. However, the test-case was useful to capture another issue. Created a new STAR: 9000999470.
    [+] Other

Details
=======

Intel MIP confirmed that they got a lot of value from PNStack which gave them good results for many circuits. For some circuits with signal-flow requirements, the result was not acceptable. The recent fix from Joe will be evaluated soon to see how well it addresses signal flow and other requirements.

Put together a list of open PNStack stars and created two new ones to help address QOR requests from Intel.
  STAR: 9000999468- PNStack to generate a custom pareto front
  STAR: 9000999466- PNStack to optimize accurately number of horizontal tracks needed per row

Create a new STAR for GCP: 9000999470- Improve area efficiency in presence of fixed figGroup(s)

Sent out to Prashant the first basic pgrid test-case with using track region api + UCM pgrid intent. Answered his questions. Also cleaned up the tcl code and sent him for further testing.

Tried out latest version of ref10. Found two issues (NMOSCAP primitive is not fully setup, some debug output from UCM/pgrid code) and reported to Ming.

Investigated one regression in berry.

Watched the demo on partial placement. Good one!

Continued with the required and overdue course.

Plan
====
- clarify "snap-origin", bbox and flip questions
- enhance TCL API to create multiple uniform grids per direction
- work on pgrid demo
- test std-part with A/B grids
- Required and overdue course from Synopsys University
- Review GCP fspec, add p-grid related input

Summary:
    [+] p-grid project
    [+] Berry regressions due to MCP changes
    [+] ETO on Monday (MLK Jr Holiday) and Friday pm. 
    [+] Misc

Gave a presentation on p-grid requirements/proposal to a wider audience. Updated the slides and published a minor rev.

Started to work on creating test-cases with p-grids. Wrote some code to create tracks/groups/regionDefs/regions. UCM coding is in progress. Core API is checked in, but UI (tcl commands and GUI) are still in the pipeline and should be finished in a few days (according to Astghik and Lucine). Investigated the ref10 test-case, but it still seems to have some issues (could not copy back result). Switched back to snps40. 

Had various conversations with Yakov, Prashant, Joe and Mirko on p-grid transfer from platform and representation in GCP/schema.

Had some conversations with Kumar and Girish on StdPart A/B grids. Provided StdPart test-cases to Kumar (for Helix and GCP). Compiled some questions and forwarded to Girish who forwarded them to Mayank who gave us some informative answers promptly.

Reviewed 14 berry regression failures. Two are due to tmp run problems. The rest require re-goldening. Informed Kumar.

Started to study the over-due course from Synopsys Univ.

Attended Ops, Triage, MCP sync meetings

Plan: 
- One remaining regression in berry
- Create UCM p-grid intent when UCM-UI-cmd code is checked in
- Required and over-due course from Synopsys University
- Review GCP fspec, add p-grid related input
- Create new PNStack stars (to meet MIP requests)

** 2016.01.11
Summary:
    [+] p-grid project
    [+] PNStack/CMOS/MCP
    [+] ETO on Monday

p-grid project:
+ We had a good review meeting with Nari. Identified a few opens and working on resolving them now.
+ Earlier, had 1:1s with Randy and Ming and updated slides in prep for meeting with Nari
+ Had a brief conversation with Mirko on passing p-grid data from platform to gcp

PNStack/CMOS/MCP:
+ Investigated a multi-row pnstack STAR from PV (9000988018- one of the pnstack mutiple row result is not expected) and re-assigned to Varun with clarification on what needs to be fixed first.
+ Had discussions with Joe, Girish, Ming and Nishath on signal-flow requirement and enhancements.. (9000985087 - incorrect signal flow in PNStack). Reviewed impact of latest fix on PNStack for signal-flow, abutment, alignment. Created a REF layout showing the right ordering of devices for signal flow and best abutment (two diff only) as per Joe's request. Experimented with Rows, manual and auto-reordering.
+ Conversation w/ Varun and Joe on the "aspect ratio" target functionality for Mcp/Top-level/Partition.

Misc:
+ Intel Berry refresh/quiz
+ Finally got a Helix standalone build (nightly failed due to disk). But, my build has problems finding correct libs (.so)
+ Read 10nm slides from MSIP with detail on instance snapping
+ One day ETO on Monday

Plan:
- Meet w/ Jon and Randy to flush out more details and resolve opens on p-grid project (IP)
- Review GCP fspec, add p-grid related input
- Create test-case with uniform track patterns
- Required and overdue course from Synopsys University

** 2015.12.13
Summary:
    [+] p-grid/t-group: Published a new minor revision on requirements after internal meetings and discussions. Responded to Nari's questions
    [+] Reviewed the latest 10nm requirements from Intel ICF
    [+] ETO on Thu/Fri

Met with Yakov, Oleg and Siarhei to finalize our internal discussions (at least for now) on p-grid requirements and implementation proposal. I think we are mostly in sync now. The few concerns raised by Siarhei are due to the more general nature of the proposal than what is absolutely necessary for Altera and ICF. I do not see a major urgency to resolve them yet. But, captured them in requirements ( -1- multiple t-groups in p-grid definition and -2- multiple p-grids in one intent). Please note that they are not material to the on-going work.

As per Nari's request, did a quick write up that clarifies why p-grids are needed (in addition to track groups) and why one global placement grid is not sufficient.  Thanks to Girish for providing his insights, too. 

Had an email conversation with Girish re: multiple track groups per orientation per p-grid. Attempted to describe one use case and captured it in the requirements document.

Defined and submitted four placement methods for fast-track patent application. Sent out supporting documentation (doc and ppt).

Reviewed the impact of Joe's latest check-in re: STAR 9k947003 (see below). Added the decoder test-case which has poorer results than we used to get. Digged up the slides I had written a while ago and sent it out with the latest results..

Had a discussion on the decorder test-case with Girish. Looked it up from older STARs and re-filed on the open MIP STAR: 9k947003 "PNStack does not abut transistors as needed". 

Debugged Joe's seg fault in Berry in GDB and identified it as a build problem, not a Berry env or a test-case problem. Sent a request to Amrish to help provide a shell to debug and fix Joe's build environment. This issue has been going on for a while now. Hope we can get it ironed out soon..

Reviewed the latest failures in berry on PNStack/StdPart. It looks like they are caused by the latest check-ins from Joe. Joe is working on fixing two regressions in PV regressions. I think he fixed them. I will look into how it impacts the regressions in Berry.


Plan: 
  - Internal patent proposal review
  - Complete task definitions for MCP related commitments in 16.06
  - Discuss with Randy precedence of p-grids vs rows in OA
  - Review plans with Barry and discuss a few open technical challenges
  - Clarify with Anoop/Girish the new 10nm requirements
  - Review SED spec
  - Reproduce the 4-input nand+inv test-case issues in berry
  - Develop a regression package w/ Intel FDK in berry
  - Follow up on routable placement challenges
  - Visualize and improve routability of row-based device placement

Summary: 
    [+] p-grid/t-config
    [+] berry setup, buildenv.bash, mcp regressions, guidance to PV team, etc..

Had a meeting with Randy, Jon and Barry on p-grid requirements and proposal. Compiled inputs, updated slides and published a major revision. 

Had a meeting with Oleg, Siarhei and Yakov to answer questions and clarify the requirements/proposal. We covered most of the p-grid part and will continue early next week to cover the tile-config part. 

Had some discussions with Girish on origin for p-grid purposes, the requirement on multiple grids per grid intent, etc.

Attended meetings on 1:1, Maxwell Patents, Nishath's OPS, Triage, MCP sync, AMS technical seminar on dual/triple patterning.

Upon Joe's request, updated the setup file in berry which started to fail recently due to the switch in gcc and oa versions. Got it to work on nightly. Found issues in running Joe's local build. Came up with a workaround and enabled him to debug in berry. 

Based on Amrish's csh env scripts, updated my buildenv.bash script, which also started to fail recently.

Looked into MCP regressions and recommended a number of tests to be added to GCP regressions.

Forwarded fspec and info on multi-row STARs to Jun upon her request.

Plan:
  - Continue p-grid/t-config review meeting with team
  - 7 new PNStack failures in Berry
  - Identify MCP tasks required for 16.06 features
  - Review docs forwarded to me from DRS

This weekly covers the last two weeks (Nov 15-30). 

Summary: 
    [+] p-grid/t-pattern requirements/proposal/project spec
    [+] row-based placement (for Intel ICF/MIP and GCP)
    [+] 3-day ETO and Thanksgiving Holiday

Wrote and published the first draft of project spec on track region handling in placement. Got some feedback and updated the document accordingly. Earlier, had a meeting with Fred and Jon to review the requirements.

Had a follow up meeting with folks from the India team to finish presentation of p-grid/t-pattern requirements/proposal.

Had a meeting with Kumar on MCP tasks, p-grid support in Partition, StdPart, and tile-config support in PNStack, RowStack (row/tile configurations), Rows/Column, also algorithms for optimal diffusion sharing, trunk generation. Sent him a paper on eulerian trail and left-edge algorithms. And the fspec doc on symmetry.

Had a couple of discussion with Yakov on p-grid handling, tech property map, row/tile configurations, etc.

Continued testing for multi-row PNStack (in berry and SNPS) and filed various STARs (bugs and enhancements). New STARs:
  -- 9000976845- PNStack to optimize abutment for each "critical" row
  -- 9000976847- PNStack crash in internal function: HandlePermutableForms
  -- 9000971713- PNStack multi-row with dynamic alignment has illegal overlap and grid violations
  -- 9000976848- PNStack multi-row should not place a pmos device over an nmos row, or vice versa
  -- 9000975953- PNStack does not honor group settings
  -- 9000975813- PNStack to prioritize series and parallel connections
  -- 9000975812- PNStack 3-row solution has only 2 p-rows and has diffusion pitch errors
  -- 9000975318- PNStack multi-row does not produce the expected NP.PN structures

Modified: 9000958660 PNStack MinRows param is not honored in one layout (and has illegal overlaps)

Plan:
  - Review docs forwarded to me from DRS
  - New build env and setup issues in berryfarm
  - Two PNStack failures in berryfarm
  - Reproduce the 4-input nand+inv test-case issues in berry
  - Review and update open STARs on MCP (PNStack/StdPart/(Packed)Partition)
  - Develop a regression package w/ Intel FDK in berry
  - Follow up on routable placement challenges
  - Visualize and improve routability of row-based device placement
  - Review specs on wide-alignment, uniform track patterns and inst snapping

** 2015.11.14
Summary: 
    [+] p-grid/t-pattern requirements/proposal
    [+] row-based placement (for Intel ICF/MIP and GCP) and berry setup
    [+] RowStack demo/testing
    [+] Berry regression reviews and re-golden

Gave a presentation of the p-grid/t-pattern requirements and proposal to folks in India. There were some good questions/discussions so we could not finish the last RowStack/PNStack section (device-level layout). We will meet to continue and wrap it up early next week.

After getting some more input from colleagues, revised the proposal with two new slides and four slides with major updates. Checked in rev0.2 into the requirements share-point: http://sp-amsg/sites/CustomDesigner/Specs/Requirement/Placement-Grids-Requirements-16 06-Track-Pattern-Support.pptx

Sent out an invite to initiate a second round of reviews by platform experts.

We also met with Girish and Ming to clarify how RowStack addresses track-pattern requirements and how it can be implemented in Maxwell. Girish and I need to discuss and flush out more details.

Spent some time to revive my RowStack test-case. The original test-case was rather big and took too long to run. Created a new sample to demonstrate how RowStack is different form a simple Column of Rows. During the prep and the demo to the team, encountered various issues. Most of them I was able to work-around, but, need to communicate them to Girish to get them fixed.

Various discussions with Girish and Joe regarding the latest feedback from MIP. Wrote a basic spice parser/flattener to help create a test-case to reproduce the new issues Girish observed in berryfarm.

Re-used a 14nm test-case in berry to create a multi-row PNStack test-case. It helped reproduce various issues Girish had observed at Intel and also pointed out some other issues. Joe is working on the more urgent star (the second below):
  STAR: 9000971711- Some of the PNStack multi-row solutions waste area
  STAR: 9000971713- PNStack multi-row with dynamic alignment has illegal overlap and grid violations

Also observed another issue with multi-row PNStack, but I realized that I have already filed this a while ago: "Error: Mcp 'PNStack1' MaxRows must be greater or equal to MinRows." It is easy to work around so not critical for now.

The berry setup I prepared for Joe a few weeks ago failed to work with Joe's recent builds. Spent some time to debug (oa libs were out of sync) and cleaned up the script. Provided him an update which helped him run the test-case for two STARs in Berry.

Reviewed StdPart releated regressions in berry and re-goldened 6 of them. 

Plan:
  - Finish presentation of p-grid/t-pattern requirements/proposal to India team
  - Reproduce the 4-input nand+inv test-case issues in berry
  - Review meeting with platform experts
  - Review and update open STARs on MCP (PNStack/StdPart/(Packed)Partition)

Did major updates to p-grid/t-pattern proposal and presented to the team. Got useful input (thanks!). Updated the slides and published them in share-point. Will present to team in Noida next.

Investigated regressions in berry due to PNStack and StdPart changes. Reviewed results for 19 tests. Now, it is down to 6. Need to re-review and re-golden this week.

Investigated Jimmy's star and communicated w/ Jimmy.. STAR 9000968867 Title: Running GCP with oaFigGroup that has placement status leads to long run time

Helped Joe work around lxCreatePins related errors.

Re-built standalone and reviewed the fix to PNStack issue for MIP. Out of two problems, the critical one is fixed and abutment works now. The second problem (center alignment causing diffusion y-grid violations) is still open. Reduced priority. Described the expected solution. Re-assigned to Joe: STAR: 9000961819- PNStack does not abut correctly with abutDiffWidth

Created Enclosure: CBF - STAR: 9000957724 - Sort the results in GCP Placement Results pane (with fixed fig-groups). And requested Varun to review code.

Summary: This week the focus was on three areas:
    [+] 2015.09-1 package testing in berry
    [+] row-based placement (for Intel ICF/MIP and GCP)
    [+] p-grid/t-pattern proposals

+++++++
Details
+++++++

2015.09-1 package testing:
    [+] Inspected 19 failed regressions in berry. Most, if not all, require only re-goldening. One test gets duplicate results, but I was not able to reproduce with manual runs. It may be due to an error in test harnesss, not in functionality. Will investigate further.
    [+] Manually tested the ICF/MIP test-cases in berry. The plan is to add these into the regressions in berry.
    [+] Verified fix for STAR: 9k952651- PNStack support for AbutmentType auto2 (S/D swapping)
    [+] Verified the GUI fix for 9k952651.

Row-based placement:
    [+] Prepared and distributed slides to visualize various cases to help clarify AbutDiffWidth requirements for GCP (re: 9k961819). 
    [+] Created test-cases in berry to exercise the new alignment features in MCP. Encountered issues and filed two stars: 
    	-- STAR: 9k966242- PNStack crashes with symmetric group
	-- STAR: 9k966244- PNStack to support alignment groups
    [+] PNStack status discussion w/ Girish
    [+] Discussions with Joe to clarify the issue with STAR: 9k965234- PNStack fails to abut adjacent source/drain on same net. It seems to be a bug in DRC-awareness. Joe promised to look into this again after fixing urgent SP1 STARS.

p-grid/t-pattern proposals:
    [+] Participated in various meetings -- a long one with Intel's James Masters, a shorter one with Fred et al to prep for Intel meeting. Also had email conversations to help clarify requirements. Had a number of email exchanges with Fred to clarify p-grid definition and how to bridge it with t-groups in tech. No decision on that front yet. After the meeting Fred also met with Lyndon and it is becoming more clear that customers want a combo solution (track patterns + placement grids) and they want both in tech. 
    [+] Had a meeting with Oleg and Siarhei and also an email conversation with Yakov on track-pattern requirements. Here are the major topics of discussion: rendering during placement as primary client of non-uniform grid points, getting grid points from design/tech, in which module the component flippping considerations fall, track patterns through hierarchy of constraints (the most basic being, e.g., a column of two rows), the need to modularize fgMinSpacing/fgPlace API and maybe introduce a new fgGrid method, etc. Cut short due to time restriction. We need to continue the investigation and discussions. 
    [+] 1:1 w/ Girish re: requirement for proximity to track type as opposed to snapping to a specific track

Other:
    [+] Encountered an issue in berry with qrsh -P iperm. Interactive testing has been hindered due to direct login violations. Filed a CCT. Got some help from Iulian and IT folks, too. Created a setup script for the team to peruse which provides three easy to use aliases for interactive testing/debugging. So far, my experience is very positive. The whole thing is streamlined/automated and I no longer get kicked out due to direct login violations. Sent out the script to Siarhei who asked about it and the rest of helix_coder.
    [+] Compiled info on how to run layout xor (geoCompare) as per Girish's request and sent it out. Also had a conversation with Oleg to clarify the recent fix from Prashant late on Friday regarding Xor_Flattend dependency. The fix should be good. Prashant also clarified over the weekend.

Plan:
    - Investigate duplicate layout issue in berry regressions
    - Re-golden berry regressions due to changes in StdPart
    - Follow up on two new test-cases from Xiaodan w/ PackedPartition and fixed fig-groups.
    - Follow up on p-grid/t-pattern proposal
    - Develop a regression package w/ Intel FDK in berry
    - Follow up on routable placement challenges
    - Improve the "optimal" chaining to reduce number of trunks (w/o dog-legs) required to route.
    - Visualize and improve routability of row-based device placement
    - Is it possible to get a good upper-bound for maximum abutment and alignment for PNStack?
    - Review specs on wide-alignment, uniform track patterns and inst snapping
    - Test topology re-use engine

    [+] Had 1:1s with Girish, Jon and Fred. There is a justified questioning and push-back on having p-grids in technology (due to duplication of t-patterns). Considering options. Will meet with Intel this week to hopefully get more clarification on requirements.
    [+] Looked into how to mix p-grids and t-patterns. It requires more investigation and promises a more elegant/combined solution.
    [+] Explored consequences of the idea of a t-pattern decorator. Promising, but requires more clarification of requirements.
    [+] Reviewed various docs (t-pattern spec from Jon, docs in share-point on 10nm initiative, Yakov's doc on t-pattern "location problem").

Row-based placement:
    [+] Testing in berry for PNStack abutment/alignment. Focused on a new test-case (nor3_inv) where dynamic alignment mode has number of issues. Packaged and informed Joe. The good news is that with the default mode (static alignment), the result is decent thanks to the fix for 9k952651.
    [+] Started to package various test-cases in berry to help regression test PNStack on Intel FDK.
    [+] Tested the fix for STAR: 9k952651- PNStack support for AbutmentType auto2 (S/D swapping). It looks good.
    [+] Re-opened the STAR above for GUI enhancement. Varun implemented it promptly. Thank you, Varun.
    [+] Testing and clarifications w/ Joe and Girish re: 9k961819- PNStack does not abut correctly with abutDiffWidth. There were two separate issues here: (a) dummy poly to be removed when S/D are on the same net. (b) When S/D are on different nets, what to do with dummy poly. (a) is more urgent and is now being fixed. Unfortunately, testing in Maxwell was unfruitful due to missing callbacks for abutment in reference45nm PKD. Planning to clarify this (issue (b)) further.
    [+] Wrote code to find the "optimal" value for the number of chains for a row of devices
    [+] Wrote code to find the "optimal" value for the number of trunks (w/o dog-leg) needed for a given row of pins (aka the single-sided channel)

Other:
    [+] Reviewed Girish's slides on apFigGroup requirements. Provided him some feedback.
    [+] Reviewed latest results for two failures in Helix/StdPart. Provided recommendations to Xiaodan.
    [+] Helped Joe with berry bash setup/qrsh alias to pick a good machine
    [+] Attended ops, triage and mcp sync-up

Plan: 
    - Verify the GUI fix for 9k952651.
    - Clarify AbutDiffWidth requirements for GCP (re: 9k961819)
    - Follow up on two new test-cases from Xiaodan w/ PackedPartition and fixed fig-groups.
    - Follow up on p-grid/t-pattern proposal
    - Develope a regression package w/ Intel FDK in berry
    - Follow up on routable placement challenges
    - Improve the "optimal" chaining to reduce number of trunks (w/o dog-legs) required to route.
    - Visualize and improve routability of row-based device placement
    - Is it possible to get a good upper-bound for maximum abutment and alignment for PNStack?
    - Review specs on wide-alignment, uniform track patterns and inst snapping
    - Test topology re-use engine

[15.09SP1]

Had some discussions with team members to clarify fixed/locked fig-group
support. Prashant committed to delivering his part this week. Thanks!


[16.06]

Coordinated bunch of meetings/discussions to focus on track pattern
support. Put together some slides to help bring the team on one page. 
We are not there yet, but, there has been some progress.

Came up with rough task breakdown and even rougher effort estimates for two
16.06 projects: track pattern support, UCM-GCP mismatch.


[Intel MIP] 

Created a suite of test-cases in SNPS to reproduce, investigate and clarify
how PNStack fails to maximize abutment due to "hard pin-alignment"
constraints. Encountered an issue and will capture as a new enhancement in
PNStack to support auto2 type of abutment (to automatically swap
source/drain terminals).

MIP: Created STAR: 9000950214- Partition with boundary association


[StdPart/Altera/Berry]

Inspected and re-goldened six StdPart tests in berry due to Joe's fix for
StdPart boundary assocication.


[Plan]

File STAR on PNStack to support for source/drain terminal swapping

Finalize task breakdown and estimates for top-down planning and nested figGroup support

Review specs on wide-alignment, uniform track patterns and inst snapping

Create STAR on "Pin master missing error" from PNStack on NVDA10nm

Test topology re-use engine

[Intel MIP]

PNStack: Put together a number of slides to summarize recent observations and
thoughts. Earlier, created and ran more, relevant test-cases in berry using
14nm data. And earlier before, had some 1:1 discussions with Girish and Joe
[Ref: 9000947003].

Boundary Association: Had various conversations with Girish, Mirko and
Joe. Did more testing to root cause issues. Seems that there are many
inaccuracies in both the documentation and the current implementation. One
good piece of news is that 9000947007 (on StdPart) is already fixed
[Ref: 9000947009].


[Intel DTS]

Sent info on the new release (2015.09) to Jose. This release might also
address the crash in symmetry, or shed more light on it..


[Intel ICF/Altera]

Have not heard back from Lyndon yet. 


[Support for 0x fixed/locked figGroup/symmetry]

Had good discussions with Prashant and Joe to coordinate the efforts.
Thanks a lot to Prashant for helping with the translator side of things.
We also discussed and clarified how to handle symmetric groups and
soft-clusters. 


[Maxwell misc.]

Reviewed the updates to the UCM fspec and participated in the review
meeting with Barry. 


[Plan]

** Weekly scratch

[Intel ICF/Altera]

Had conversations with Joe, Girish, Mayank and Ming re: the new requirement
on gridded StdPartition. Emailed Lyndon to get feedback on our current
thinking about the problem and the interface to support.


[Intel DTS]

Intel DTS reported a crash in Partition with symmetry. Tried to reproduced
in house using the releae used by Intel (2014.09SP1-3), but failed.

They could not give us the 10nm test-case. So, provided a number of
suggestions to work around the crash. One of them provided a different
stack trace. Identified another option and communicated to Intel. Waiting
for their response.

While trying to reproduce, encountered a problem and filed STAR:
9000946339- Partition with groups not to abut devices by default.

Earlier provided symmetry and ECO slides to Jose and answered some
technical questions.

Also filed a STAR on the issue I observed with non-disjoint symmetric
groups create: STAR: 9000945863- Partition with non-disjoint groups goes
into infinite loop


[Intel MIP]

Tried to clarify for Mirko the request from Girish on boundaryassoc need on
left/right for Column.

Provide a test case to Girish to demonstrate how to use Partition with
groups + CustomSpacing with DRC/short-aware and abut devices. This could be
an alternative to StructuredPartition of PNStacks which had some issues.

Worked on another Intel MIP issue with StdPart of PNStacks, where there is
one PNStack per row and it hits an infeasibility. Discussed further with
Girish and Joe. Created STAR: 9000946288- StructuredPartition gives an
internal error message.


[Abutment]

Investigated two abutment related issues in presense of dummy poly. Put
together a slide to clarify the need to share dummy poly. Thanks to Girish
for his slide that shows when dummy poly needs to be automatically removed
to share diffusions.


[10nm]

Created a STAR to track issue observed in 10nm ref PDK: 9000945834-
Incorrect exception thrown in SDL flow -- looking for lib property map.

Created a more complex Helix test case (with both NMOS and PMOS) on nvda10
PDK. Sent to Siarhei. With latest version of the tech file, DRC result
looks good.

Also tested PNStack on nvda10. Got a "Pin master missing error". Informed
Joe. Will file a STAR next.


[Support for 0x fixed/locked figGroup/symmetry]

Set up a simpler test-case with locked group and ran GCP to show Joe that
it is preserved as a group-ucell. Also showed him how to run gcp executable
from shell directly.

As per Joe's request, pointed out code/entry point to top-level solver


[Modular Grid/Track Pattern]

Gave a presentation to Fred and Randy. In preparation for it, reviewed the
latest communication between Girish and various team mates and Lyndon. And,
had conversations w/ Girish re: Gridding Decorator Intent (yet to be
defined in UCM).


[Misc]

Helped Siarhei with partial checkouts in CVS and also investigated the data
in repository and suggested how to reduce the full check out time.

Updated ReadMe in Berry regressions with info on incremental check outs.

Reviewed release notes for Helix and Pycell Studio.

=== Summary ===

[+] Managing general release activities during Ming's FTO.  
[+] Maintenance of more than 30 test-cases in Berry-farm.
[+] Work on various issues observed at Intel by Girish. Details below.
[+] Work on 10nm NVDA skill PDK and internal reference PDK
[+] Support Biying on topology re-use project
[+] Please note that this weekly covers the period since August 3rd. So,
there are lots of detail below. 

=== Details ===

[2015.09 Release (standalone)]

[+] Inspected the three failures in PNStack in berry using release
package. They look OK. Thanks to Siarhei for keeping a local copy of
goldens for these for future runs. 
[+] Verified that one PNStack test in berry fails release package but
passes nightly. 
[+] Inspected the failure in PV regressions due to Oleg's latest fix. Looks
good. Requested re-goldening. 
[+] Built main latest and tested 14 failures in harness. Ran tests again
after Oleg's fix. Observed that DRC spacing is not sufficient. Informed Oleg.
[+] Re-ran 11 failures reported by Siarhei in berry. Corrected two failures
due to goldens based on a previous RedHat run. 
[+] Investigated two failures from Siarhei. One is due to a bad golden
file. I fixed it. The other is an out of date golden file in Siarhei's
sandbox. Informed him. 
[+] Investigated remaining failures in my full run. All are due to
out-of-date goldens.. Realized that regression script was overriding CVS
files. Informed Prashant who fixed the issue. 
[+] Investigated and re-goldened 35 test-cases various times due to changes in
AVP/MCP (one due to enhancement for smaller test-cases, two due to support
for layers without min-spacing rule in santana-tech). 
[+] Confirmed that the remaining 6 regressions in Berry are not due to
StructuredPartition. Asked Siarhei to roll-back to help identify the
culprit. Thanks a lot, Siarhei! 
[+] Provided info to Matthew regarding AlignBoundaryLayersToAxis in
presence of Frame constraint. Reviewed latest draft from Matthew on
symmetry in Partition, StructuredPartition, CustomSpacing and provided
further feedback. 

[Intel]

[+] Reproduced the problem with CustomSpacing with short-awareness reported
by Girish. Filed a showstopper: STAR: 9000942079- CustomSpacing
CorrectAfterForDrc creates a short. After getting hints from Oleg,
tried to work around by updating Santana tech. However, noticed that we
still get DRCs after short is eliminated. This was also later fixed by
Oleg. 
[+] Created a test-case to reproduce a problem Girish observed at Intel
with a branch-clone of PNStack. Filed STAR: 9000940730- BranchClone does
not work with PNStack . 
[+] Tried to reproduce PNStack abutment problem Girish observed at
Intel on 14nm. Created a similar chain of 5 inverters in house. It worked with
cni130. Requested a test-case in berry.. After getting the test-case,
reproduced it and informed Joe how to understand the shorts (STAR:
9000939940- PNStack creates shorts.) Also suggested a temporary fix to Joe
after he debugged and informed that ndiff/pdiff spacing info was missing in
Santana.tech. Had discussions with Siarhei and Mirko, who helped with
existing API in Helix to compute minimum spacing when Santana.tech does not
provide an explicit API. Joe later improved his code fix making use of
Mirko's pointer. Thanks to all!
[+] While working on the PNStack abutment problem above, observed that with
the recent AbutDiffWidth option, PNStack abutment has some issues. Created
new STAR: 9000941136- PNStack AbutDiffWidth option has errors.
[+] Had some discussions w/ Girish on Intel MIP evaluation the nature of
the test-case, various options we have, some of which are more experimental
in nature. Sent him the latest schema for Partition with soft groups. Next,
planning to put together a sample test-case in house for further piloting.
[+] Discussions to converge on various technical challenges: 
  -- Altera cell placement flow requirement (native STD-cell gridding) --
  with Joe, Girish and Ming 
  -- Pin placement for ICF and Maxwell (handling pin constraints and
  terminal constraints with/without edge assignment) with Kumar and
  Girish. 
  -- Row-stack automation review, next steps with Kumar and Girish
[+] Reviewed the pin spec from Girish
[+] Review Track Pattern slides from Girish

[Maxwell]

[+] After Mirko's report that there needs to be a fixed or locked element
for a GroupUCell to be create from an figGroup, I updated the STAR data to
have a locked elem in the figGroup. However, Joe still reports that there
are no GroupUCell's. Need to debug with Mirko further: (STAR: 9000920785-
CDPV:: the locked oaFigGroup is treated as normal oaFigGroup.)
[+] Helped Yakov with purify build of gcp (gcp-pg) from SWE
[+] Reviewed and provided feedback on Barry's spec to handle dummies. 
[+] Discussions with Girish, Barry and Ming re: UCM-GCP priorities and
custom-construction. 
[+] Discussion w/ Girish/Mirko on SED generated constraints for CMOS and
its support by PNStack. Earlier, reviewed the req slides Girish forwarded
to me. 
[+] Put together a table to manage MLK's based on the last two runs.

[10nm readiness]

[+] Set up Helix to enable a first run on 10nm nvda10 on Samsung secure
machine. Used Schematic driven (SDL) flow, however, bypassed some of the
setup details cndfls requires, by manually configuring the hxnet
files. Observed various DRC errors on a purely NMOS test-case with one Row.
The DRC seem to be internal to pcells from the PDK. Informed Siarhei. Next,
planning to create another, slightly more complex test-case with NMOS +
PMOS. The first had only NMOS..  
[+] Worked on NVDA10 PCX setup. Got inconsistent versions for PCX, CD and
Maxwell. Worked with Prashant and Ming to fix the setup using 2014.12-SP2-2 
version of CD and 2014.09-SP1-1 version of Helix built with GCC 4.72.
[+] Provided info on 10nm ref pdk to Siarhei. 10nm test-case with one Row
has four issues. Sent test-case to Siarhei. Siarhei pointed out the problem
with the usage, and has also fixed one of the issues. I need to file a STAR
for one of the other minor issues. 


[Topology re-use]

[+] Did a detailed code review w/ Biying before she left.
[+] Provided a test-case with StartLayout option (ECO) to Biying..
[+] Provided a test-case with non-slicing placement..
[+] Reviewed Biying's report and respond to her questions.
[+] Had a 1:1 w/ Girish regarding the topology re-use project and requirements
[+] Had conversations with Biying regarding handling non-slicing floor-plans..


[Misc]

[+] Attended core team meetings during Ming's ETO. 
[+] Updated STARs as per triage meetings. 
[+] Compiled modular grid/routing track related docs/specs and sent out to
Siarhei. 
[+] Reviewed track region spec in Maxwell. 
[+] Queried CRM to identify SP1 tasks and informed Siarhei as per his request.
[+] Studied a presentation on Viper: spatially sorted layout files.
[+] ETO: Aug 5/6 (feels like ages ago!)

[Plan]

[-] Develop and communicate spec to address ICF's requirement on gridded StdPart.
[-] 10nm NVIDIA -- Create a more complex test case (with both NMOS and PMOS)
[-] Fixed/Locked figGroup related STARs
[-] File a STAR on the issue I observed with non-disjoint symmetric groups
[-] Symmetry on top-level components
[-] Internal test-case and piloting for Intel MIP
[-] Review track region spec in Maxwell
[-] Update ReadMe in Berry regressions with info on incremental check outs

[+] Support Biying on topology re-use project

[+] Please note that this weekly covers the period since August 3rd. So,
there are lots of detail below. 


=== Details ===


[2015.09 Release (standalone)]

[+] Inspected the three failures in PNStack in berry using release
package. They look OK. Thanks to Siarhei for keeping a local copy of
goldens for these for future runs. 

[+] Verified that one PNStack test in berry fails release package but
passes nightly. 

[+] Inspected the failure in PV regressions due to Oleg's latest fix. Looks
good. Requested re-goldening. 

[+] Built main latest and tested 14 failures in harness. Ran tests again
after Oleg's fix. Observed that DRC spacing is not sufficient. Informed Oleg.

[+] Re-ran 11 failures reported by Siarhei in berry. Corrected two failures
due to goldens based on a previous RedHat run. 

[+] Investigated two failures from Siarhei. One is due to a bad golden
file. I fixed it. The other is an out of date golden file in Siarhei's
sandbox. Informed him. 

[+] Investigated remaining failures in my full run. All are due to
out-of-date goldens.. Realized that regression script was overriding CVS
files. Informed Prashant who fixed the issue. 

[+] Investigated and re-goldened 35 test-cases various times due to changes in
AVP/MCP (one due to enhancement for smaller test-cases, two due to support
for layers without min-spacing rule in santana-tech). 

[+] Confirmed that the remaining 6 regressions in Berry are not due to
StructuredPartition. Asked Siarhei to roll-back to help identify the
culprit. Thanks a lot, Siarhei! 

[+] Provided info to Matthew regarding AlignBoundaryLayersToAxis in
presence of Frame constraint. Reviewed latest draft from Matthew on
symmetry in Partition, StructuredPartition, CustomSpacing and provided
further feedback. 



[Intel]

[+] Reproduced the problem with CustomSpacing with short-awareness reported
by Girish. Filed a showstopper: STAR: 9000942079- CustomSpacing
CorrectAfterForDrc creates a short. After getting hints from Oleg,
tried to work around by updating Santana tech. However, noticed that we
still get DRCs after short is eliminated. This was also later fixed by
Oleg. 

[+] Created a test-case to reproduce a problem Girish observed at Intel
with a branch-clone of PNStack. Filed STAR: 9000940730- BranchClone does
not work with PNStack . 

[+] Tried to reproduce PNStack abutment problem Girish observed at
Intel on 14nm. Created a similar chain of 5 inverters in house. It worked with
cni130. Requested a test-case in berry.. After getting the test-case,
reproduced it and informed Joe how to understand the shorts (STAR:
9000939940- PNStack creates shorts.) Also suggested a temporary fix to Joe
after he debugged and informed that ndiff/pdiff spacing info was missing in
Santana.tech. Had discussions with Siarhei and Mirko, who helped with
existing API in Helix to compute minimum spacing when Santana.tech does not
provide an explicit API. Joe later improved his code fix making use of
Mirko's pointer. Thanks to all!

[+] While working on the PNStack abutment problem above, observed that with
the recent AbutDiffWidth option, PNStack abutment has some issues. Created
new STAR: 9000941136- PNStack AbutDiffWidth option has errors.

[+] Had some discussions w/ Girish on Intel MIP evaluation the nature of
the test-case, various options we have, some of which are more experimental
in nature. Sent him the latest schema for Partition with soft groups. Next,
planning to put together a sample test-case in house for further piloting.

[+] Discussions to converge on various technical challenges: 
  -- Altera cell placement flow requirement (native STD-cell gridding) --
  with Joe, Girish and Ming 
  -- Pin placement for ICF and Maxwell (handling pin constraints and
  terminal constraints with/without edge assignment) with Kumar and
  Girish. 
  -- Row-stack automation review, next steps with Kumar and Girish

[+] Reviewed the pin spec from Girish

[+] Review Track Pattern slides from Girish



[Maxwell]

[+] After Mirko's report that there needs to be a fixed or locked element
for a GroupUCell to be create from an figGroup, I updated the STAR data to
have a locked elem in the figGroup. However, Joe still reports that there
are no GroupUCell's. Need to debug with Mirko further: (STAR: 9000920785-
CDPV:: the locked oaFigGroup is treated as normal oaFigGroup.)

[+] Helped Yakov with purify build of gcp (gcp-pg) from SWE

[+] Reviewed and provided feedback on Barry's spec to handle dummies. 

[+] Discussions with Girish, Barry and Ming re: UCM-GCP priorities and
custom-construction. 

[+] Discussion w/ Girish/Mirko on SED generated constraints for CMOS and
its support by PNStack. Earlier, reviewed the req slides Girish forwarded
to me. 


[+] Put together a table to manage MLK's based on the last two runs.



[10nm readiness]

[+] Set up Helix to enable a first run on 10nm nvda10 on Samsung secure
machine. Used Schematic driven (SDL) flow, however, bypassed some of the
setup details cndfls requires, by manually configuring the hxnet
files. Observed various DRC errors on a purely NMOS test-case with one Row.
The DRC seem to be internal to pcells from the PDK. Informed Siarhei. Next,
planning to create another, slightly more complex test-case with NMOS +
PMOS. The first had only NMOS..  

[+] Worked on NVDA10 PCX setup. Got inconsistent versions for PCX, CD and
Maxwell. Worked with Prashant and Ming to fix the setup using 2014.12-SP2-2 
version of CD and 2014.09-SP1-1 version of Helix built with GCC 4.72.

[+] Provided info on 10nm ref pdk to Siarhei. 10nm test-case with one Row
has four issues. Sent test-case to Siarhei. Siarhei pointed out the problem
with the usage, and has also fixed one of the issues. I need to file a STAR
for one of the other minor issues. 



[Topology re-use]

[+] Did a detailed code review w/ Biying before she left.

[+] Provided a test-case with StartLayout option (ECO) to Biying..

[+] Provided a test-case with non-slicing placement..

[+] Reviewed Biying's report and respond to her questions.

[+] Had a 1:1 w/ Girish regarding the topology re-use project and requirements

[+] Had conversations with Biying regarding handling non-slicing floor-plans..



[Misc]

[+] Attended core team meetings during Ming's ETO. 

[+] Updated STARs as per triage meetings. 

[+] Compiled modular grid/routing track related docs/specs and sent out to
Siarhei. 

[+] Reviewed track region spec in Maxwell. 

[+] Queried CRM to identify SP1 tasks and informed Siarhei as per his request.

[+] Studied a presentation on Viper: spatially sorted layout files.

[+] ETO: Aug 5/6 (feels like ages ago!)



[Plan]

[-] Develop and communicate spec to address ICF's requirement on gridded StdPart.
[-] 10nm NVIDIA -- Create a more complex test case (with both NMOS and PMOS)
[-] Fixed/Locked figGroup related STARs
[-] File a STAR on the issue I observed with non-disjoint symmetric groups
[-] Symmetry on top-level components
[-] Internal test-case and piloting for Intel MIP
[-] Review track region spec in Maxwell
[-] Update ReadMe in Berry regressions with info on incremental check outs

Hi Mayank,

This was a very helpful write up. Thank you and please continue sending me your summaries.

Specifically, can you please clarify what is meant by “Native Legalizer” below:
•	> Native Legalizer capability Specs: > Girish to check with Bulent on Native capability
I have seen the spec on “Native STD-cell gridding in Helix” and we will plan to support that. Our core engine does support instance specific grids. 
But, is there any other aspect to the “Native Legalizer”? If there are any other slides
Regards,
Bulent

Subject: WW34: Meeting Minutes: Helix Development Weekly Meeting

Hi All, 
 
        Please find the meeting summary below:
Intel Confidential, 
Attendees: 
Intel: Mayank, Harish, Laya, Savan
SNPS:  Girish 
                Anafi: Lyndon
 
Agenda:
1.	Open …… All
2.	Anafi Issues/Update …….. Lyndon
3.	Helix Issue update ….. Intel/SNPS
 
Opens:
•	Girish got a mail on support for 10nm base layer RUNDA. Indu to facilitate in account creation. DONE

•	Support for cellView has been added. (Can be loaded within Helix flow)
•	Support for text file to be done if requested
•	Lyndon: Preference to have non-WSP alternative also (how to choose intermediate format? Can it be file, independent of the platform)
•	CD: Requesting Anoop/Routing team to help in deciding the final format> In Maxwell it will be supported natively. Before that a conversion script can be supported to yml. 
•	Ankita: Suggestion to create multiple trackPattern.yml files and support in Finish script
•	Savan: 1273 Double Guard Rings(np70ring) support:
•	Pdk733: r2.0 support in Helix
•	Pdk736: r2.3 support in library. Plan to support in next release r2.4
•	Girish: Maxwell handling of mod_grid for oaTech
•	Should be coded in oaTech but refinable using Design specific constraints
•	Mayank:
•	Nwell Spacing support> Mayank to pass a testcase to Prayash
•	New GRs support > Done.  Pdk756: LU ring supported
•	Auto-order: To ignore Gate nets for maximal abutment. Girish to check with R&D if some extra parameter can be exposed
•	Ankita: 
•	CDF parameters not updated (ETA: 1509. When creating hxNet cdfParameters will be read & updated as oaProp in the resulting Layout as CDF). > Mayank to Validate
•	pinShapeGridding cause 1 pin to be lost when 2 pins try to move to the same track> Known limitation. User responsibility to create pin Constraint with sufficient spacing. Ankita to check an alternate 
•	Half Period placeGrid Request > Half cells to be flipped for optimal layout 
•	Adding more templates stackTemplate.yml (customizable DTCs)
> Use CNI_DTC_CONFIG_FILE
> None: Can be used for customized values which are not updated in stackTemplate.yml     
•	Indu: 
•	Hierarchical Region sharing : Mayank/Girish> Try Marking layer can be used to create Overlay. May have to merge this Mod Grid concept
•	ADT enablement update
•	SNPS gave feedback after studying ADT testcases that Abutment protocol needs to rewrite tcl callbacks as native OA callbacks (the values returned by native python callbacks were not in sync with tcl callbacks). Tcl callbacks will be supported in Maxwell
•	Commitment from library teams to support that. Mayank to schedule a meeting early next week (ww32.1/2). DONE. Mayank to send over the 73 Library to Girish
•	Krishna can take help from Girish/Bulent to escalate debug. Mayank to provide the latest library to Girish
•	Pin Placement Issues : DONE
•	WSP and Helix > DONE
•	Pooja: A function to extract trackPatterns saved in the design can be used. 
•	Harish: Design Defaults can also be used. These can be accessed without opening layout
•	Wiretype is not supported for most trackPatterns. Utility for modify wireType on the fly. 
•	Prayash is working on this: Explore possibility of using design default or create a dummy layout to load to generate trackPattern.yml on the fly & save in the Helix Working Directory
•	Resistor placement (sharing regions across hierarchies)
•	Constraint creation doesn’t support objects from multiple level of hierarchy 
•	No support for partial flattening of hierarchy across any tools (totally new requirement)
•	Using overlay may be cumbersome
•	Partial Halo Ring is not supported right now
•	Flattening to be tried out before other things
•	Production build schedule
•	2015-09 : pdk r1.0 release
•	Main focus will be automation of Pattern creation for row stack > Auto-ordering support in 1509. 
•	Build is planned for first week 0f Sep-2015. First kit to be shared by WW34
•	Expecting initial version of MaxWell to be available in the build > Not for Helix
•	Usability and Error reporting in standalone helix 
•	Due to issues in Abutment protocol support from both Library and Helix, we may need to postpone the Abutment protocol to an “Intermediate Helix Kit”. Krishna to get back on ETA
•	Halo Ring support > Offset in the ring & empty spaces
•	Pin enhancements support (M1, negative pins etc)
•	2014-09-SP1-1: pdk r0.5 release
•	DummyLCV & Tap supported with SP1-3
•	Open: Logic to choose dummies based on devices in the rowStack>> Apply filter based on device types
•	Abutment Support issues: Request to provide support for Custom Pcells with Auto1 support from Helix R&D. Workaround to use manual ordering or add instances to abutMaster list in stackTemplate.yml. 
•	Girish suggested providing a variable in ADT abutment protocol that can return different values when being called from Helix & CDesigner
 
•	2016-06
•	Helix features will be migrated to Maxwell
•	Users are expected to migration form Helix to Maxwell
•	OA DM5 planned for 1509 Helix release. Does Intel need early access to test libraries on this version? Yes. Girish to pass on in WW34. DONE. Check with regressions for all library cells
•	Anafi issues 
•	Helix Usage on Anafi:
•	73 Netlist(but fairly independent of FDK release) but 75 SDL. Validation concerns? Lyndon to check internally and get back
•	Device Level readiness : Requested are the fundamental enhancements in Core Helix. (RowStack with additional automation may solve this for 10nm)
>>> Auto-ordering devices in row to maximize abutment in row targeted for 1509. New pattern generator should be able to do that. 
>>> Multi-row gate alignment & auto-ordering not planned for 1509. Further plan need prioritization from Lyndon 
>>> ADT support can use the code for devices
•	Choices of track patterns & tool limitations may be the major causes of this
•	More useful for cell based placement. 1x & 2x are supported but we may support multiple height placement (partition based on prboundary may help)
•	Helix R&D need direction between rowStack/pnStack for further development. ETA WW23
•	Eval to start by Early May (r0.4 – pre-release r0.5). Real Design Start: Late Q3 tentatively
•	RowStack Issues: Target kit 75.6 r0.5
•	Layout Regeneration flow: 
•	Ankita can share the migrated data in this meeting or some other forum
•	Brief status update shared. First look from Lyndon seems that results are good quality & we may work on area optimization(always a priority for FPGAs) further. 
•	Open : 1275 release update
•	Bus notation for templates: [] is Verilog Name Space. Cdl supports both. Evaluate where the change is needed CD/Helix/Library. HSD filled. > Target still r1.0
•	ADT abutment: May have a difference between Virtuoso & CD(eg Mirroring is not happening with Auto-abutment in CD). Enhancement on Helix to support non-Mos Pcells. Supporting Abutment protocol in rowStack with some known limitations. 
•	Open: Fix for pins in negative axis & Import Floorplan without floating pins issue. Girish : DONE
•	Space to be inserted in beginning of pattern. May need cdl based flow for 1275 data. To be supported in rowStack for r1.0 > DONE. Ankita/Mayank to verify the fix
•	Coloring of pins support. Lower layer(M1) pins support. DONE
•	Native Legalizer capability Specs: > Girish to check with Bulent on Native capability
•	Pin Placement should have label attached to it & should place Pin Layers > DONE
•	Pooja: How to filter out the schematic dummies from reaching or being constrained in schematic? Answer: Add lvsIgnore property to the device. Ask AIP DA to have a script to add this property to all dummies hierarchically. AR: Mayank to follow up. Add this to the validation scenarios. 
•	Routing Aware placement: Synopsys needs specs
•	Show real scenario of changes made to ensure routability
•	Capability to automatically choose DTC based on the spacing needed for routability (being enabled in migration utility)
•	Open: (Ankita/Prayash): Suggestion for Checker for Track Available in the overlapping region with Device Diffusion. Need a way to identify which track to use? AR: Ankita to develop slides to convey this as a spec. Girish to spec out based on Tool level understanding. DONE on the Spec. Waiting to hear back from SNPS discussions 
•	Laya: Require support for M1 pins. > DONE
 
FDK Release schedule(internal milestones):
•	1273.3 1.8; Shelf ww33.4, Freeze ww35.4(SP1-2) (Will get pushed out. Laya to confirm)
•	1273.6 2.3; shelf ww34.4, Freeze ww36.4(?). Girish to confirm if SP1-3 is production build
•	1275 0.4; shelf ww05.4, Freeze ww08.4
•	1275 0.5; shelf ww23, Freeze ww25 (SP1-1)
•	1275 1.0; shelf ww40.4, Freeze ww42.4 (1509)
 
Helix development update/issue sheet:
•	Mayank presented the Stdcell Native gridding spec. Girish to confirm the status on this: 
Suggestions/Feedbacks: 
•	Mayank: Check if Flip-Y is really allowed for these cells with the stdcell team. But in that case gridding for such a cell will have to be non-default. (Allow Horizontal flips off by default. Answer for this will impact the scenario when we turn this variable ON. Flipping + Legalization may need extra effort)
>> Verify turning this parameter ON
>> Check if all even odd equivalent cells are same width
>> Mayank:  Flip all cells from stdcell library & see if equivalents are still retained using the current legalization logic
>> Open:  If even & odd have width differences then how to change the legalization strategy? Harish: Take Offline on discussion with Stdcell Library team
•	Check if there could be stdcells which don’t have an equivalent B cell (Possible cases are when the cell starts consistently with A/B grid and has a double pitch so it also ends at the same grid)
•	Helix R&D should check how to leave spaces for transitition between 1 grid to another
•	Check with stdcell team, if the filler cells will be available from A-B transitions and vice versa

AR:
1.	Ankita to send snapshot to Girish on rowStack vs row spacing issue. 
2.	Pin shape gridding should be made independent of top metal. Consider de-coupling of Top Metal for Pin Optimization and boundary snapping after feedback from Lyndon >> STAR Filled
3.	QA automation:
i.	Girish to evaluate creation on some Helix internal testcases. Unit Testcases for rowStack. Anafi testcases on 1273 are already added (& run daily) 
ii.	Prayash has created 2-3 testcases as a part of megaTest. WIP on contribution on Design Testcases(Mayank to follow up) from all team members. MIP OR testcase. Anafi Testcase for RowStack.Plan to add ADT based RowStacks for r1.0 release (Abutment protocol testcases being generated by library team. )
iii.	Prayash to present the Testing Scenarios WW32 meeting
 
 
Thanks and Regards
Mayank
