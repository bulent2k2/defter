Labourdonnais-McDonnell, London 1834 -- World Champions at their Best (1)
From the 1st Match, 3rd Match Game. 
Though no official World Championship title existed at this time, the
Frenchman Labourdonnais (1797-1840) was universally accepted as the finest
player in the world. When England's best player -- McDonnell (1798-1835)
challenged this view, a classic set of six matches was arranged between the
two, totaling 85 games in all!  

Labourdonnais' decisive victory in these matches (plus 18!) made the
Frenchman a legend in his own time. In fact, up to the emergence of Morphy
in 1858, many people felt that Labourdonnais' strength would never be
equaled.  

Once wealthy, Labourdonnais somehow lost his fortune and was reduced to
playing chess for money at the end of his life. In fact, things got so
desperate that he began to sell all his possessions (he even sold his
clothes!) so that he could feed his wife and himself. Poor Labourdonnais,
faced with eviction and starvation and consumed by a number of illnesses,
died in a Parisian garret in 1840.  

The rules for these matches stated that no color change would occur if a
draw resulted. After Labourdonnais drew the first game with the White
pieces he was given White again. After the second game was also drawn he
was given White for a third time. In the present position (which was the
third game of the match and was reached after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4

44.Qc4 Rh1+ 45.Ke2 Rxb1) things look completely hopeless for
Labourdonnais. He is a Rook down and his King also doesn't appear to be
very comfortable. How did he save himself?

---------------------------------------------------------
Labourdonnais was a proud man who usually was in good cheer. However, when he was losing, his personality would change and he would begin to swear endless oaths. We can only guess what he sounded like when he reached the poor position featured in this problem!

1.Rxd4! gives up another Rook so that the long diagonal to the Black King
can be utilized. This kind of desperate measure is called for since normal
moves would just be waiting for the ax to fall. 

1...Rb2+ is the best winning try. Black remains up an Exchange but finds
that the resulting position is probably impossible to win.  

For the crucial capture of the Rook by 1...exd4, see the Variation.
---------------------------------------------------------
Black is up the Exchange, but the open position of his King, and the fact
that the White Bishop will soon prove to be active, gives Labourdonnais
excellent chances to hold the game.

2.Rd2 gets the Rook out of danger and blocks the enemy Rook's attack on the
White King. Though White will end up down an Exchange, the open nature of
the Black King will make any winning chances problematic.

2...Rxd2+ exchanges pieces in the hope that the extra Exchange will prove
to be sufficient for the victory.

---------------------------------------------------------
The critical juncture has passed and now White is simply an Exchange
down. However, he has every reason to hope for a draw because the enemy
pawn on b7 is vulnerable to an attack by the White Bishop and the Black
King is always in danger of being checked. In the actual game, Black was
not able to find a winning idea.

3.Kxd2 is clearly the only sane choice.

3...Rd8+ gets the Rook into the game and continues the attack against the
White King.

White wants to get out of check in such a way that precludes the Black
Queen from jumping into the attack with gain of time. White also wants to
hold firmly onto his pieces and pawns on f2 and f3. Find a move that
accomplishes all these goals. 

4.Ke2! gets out of check and stops the Black Queen from jumping into the
assault with a check of its own. When you are defending, make sure
everything is well guarded. 

4...Qh6 threatens a big check on d2.

5.Qc3! keeps an eye on both d2 and c1. It also forces Black to react to the
newly created threat against the e5- pawn. Mixing defense and attack like
this is usually a good idea. 

5...Qg7 passively defends e5. Black was probably a bit upset here since his
hoped for win was not proving to be such an easy acquisition. 

The White Queen already stands well. Can the position of the other White
forces be improved?

6.Be4! firmly blocks the e-pawn, takes aim at the Black King and frees the
third rank for a possible Qh3+. After 6.Be4 the White army is shown to be
extremely well coordinated.

6...Kg8 steps off the h-file but the active White army is now posing too
many problems for Black to have any real chances for a win. Black rejected
6...Qg4+ since 7.Bf3! threatens the Queen and both pawns on b7 and
e5. Black would then have nothing better than a repetition of moves by
7...Qg7. 

7.Qb3+ creates an immediate draw since a perpetual check or the win of the
b7-pawn is now forced.

7...Kf8 fails but so does 7...Kh8 8.Qh3+ and 7...Qf7 8.Qxf7+ followed by
9.Bxb7. Black can no longer hope to win the game and he only plays another
move or two due to an overwhelming sense of depression. 

8.Qf3+! forces the win of the b7-pawn. This leads to an easy draw for White
because Rook vs. Bishop (with no pawns on the board) is known as unwinnable
for the Rook.

8...Qf7 is as good as anything. Black has already resigned himself to the
upcoming declaration of peace. 

9.Bxb7 eats the pawn and keeps the Black King on f8. 

9...Qxf3+ exchanges the Queens but forces the White King to a better
post. Remember that Kings love to advance once an endgame is reached. 

10.Kxf3 brings the White King closer to the center. The players agreed to a
draw here since Black can no longer hope to win the game since he has
nothing left to attack: White's King is safe (on e4 or e3), his f2-pawn is
safely defended by the King (and it may advance to f4 and exchange itself
for the e5-pawn) and his b5-pawn can either advance and threaten to promote
or be safely defended by Bc6.

Score: 93%

Grandmaster Andy Soltis wrote in his recent endgame book that one should
not trade down into a king and pawn ending unless one could safely bet
one's first-born on the outcome of the game. In the game Wolski-Peters,
American Open 1997, White just traded rooks from a slightly better position
to reach an unclear pawn ending. I, playing White, anticipated a very long
line which ended in Black drawing only after most precise play. However, I
had missed a minor detail in my calculations. 
---------------------------------------------------------
Black is up a pawn, but both his pawns on d4 and a4 are weak.

** .. Bariz hamleler.. siyah f3'e saldiriyor, beyaz da a4'e.
1...Kg5 activates the king and eyes White's f3-pawn.
2.Kxd4 captures the bothersome d-pawn. If 2.f4+, then 2...Kg4 is fine for
Black. 
---------------------------------------------------------
Black's king is penetrating into White's position.

2...Kf4 makes sure that White does not keep the passed f- pawn.

3.Kc3 aims for the lonely a4-pawn.
---------------------------------------------------------
** This is the critical moment of the game.** 
3...b5!! was played instantly by IM Jack Peters. He thought this was the
only move to secure the draw for Black, but it turns out that Black is
winning now. I had only expected 3...Kxf3, when Black would be able to draw
only with best defense, e.g., 4.Kb4 Ke4 5.Kxa4 Kd4 6.Kb5 Kd3 7.b3 Kc3 8.Kc6
Kxb3 9.Kxc7 Kxc4 10.Kxd6 b5 11.Ke5 b4 12.d6 b3 13.d7 b2 14.d8=Q b1=Q
15.Qc8+ Kb3! (this is the only move that draws for Black).  

Sometimes when one looks far ahead in a long line, one can miss an
important detail early on. 

4.cxb5 is White's best try. If 4.Kb4, then Black would soon win the d5-pawn
after 4...bxc4. In the game I resigned here, being low on time and not
seeing any hope. However, when I extended my hand toward Peters, he thought
that I wanted to offer him a draw and demanded that I first make a move! It
was in the late evening hours and we were both getting a bit confused. I
looked at the board for another minute or two and then insisted on my
resignation! Of course, I should have played 4.cxb5 first, and then see
whether he would find the win.
4...Kxf3 first captures the outside passer. If 4.Ke5?, then 5.Kc4 would put
Black in zugzwang. 
5.Kb4 looks for active counterplay. If 5.Kd3, then 5...Kf4 6.Kd4 Kf5 puts
White in zugzwang, e.g., 7.Kd3 Ke5 8.Kc4 Ke4. 
---------------------------------------------------------
Black now has a clear winning plan.
5...Ke4 attacks the isolated d5-pawn. Now it becomes clear why 3...b5!! was
such a great move. Black will soon have a passed d-pawn.
6.Kxa4 first removes the a4-pawn. If 6.b6, then 6...cxb6 7.Kb5 Kxd5 wins
for Black. 
---------------------------------------------------------
Now it looks deceptively simple.
6...Kxd5 wins the isolated d5-pawn and gives Black a passed d-pawn.
7.b6! is White's only chance. After I resigned a few moves earlier, both
Peters and GM Pavel Blatny thought that I could have drawn with this move. 
---------------------------------------------------------
White's counterplay is almost enough for a draw.
7...cxb6 is forced.
8.Kb5 attacks the b6-pawn.
---------------------------------------------------------
White's counterplay is almost enough for a draw.
8...Ke4 gets out of the way of the d-pawn and covers many squares along the
pawn's traveling route. For that reason 8...Ke6? 9.Kxb6 d5 10.Kc5 only
draws. 
9.Kxb6 wins the b6-pawn.
---------------------------------------------------------
Both pawns are five steps away from queening, but White's king is in the
way of its pawn.
9...d5 gets the pawn going.
10.b4 also advances a pawn.
---------------------------------------------------------
Both pawns are four steps away from queening, but White's king is in the
way of its pawn.
10...d4 gets the pawn closer.
11.b5 also advances a pawn.
---------------------------------------------------------
White's king is in the way of its pawn.
After 11...d3, it becomes clear that Black will queen first.
12.Kc7 steps out of the way of the pawn. Any other king move would meet the
same plan.
---------------------------------------------------------
When playing king and pawn endings, it's important to know how a queen does
against a pawn on the seventh rank supported by its king.
12...d2 gets ready for promotion.
13.b6 advances the pawn again.
---------------------------------------------------------
A queen wins against a passed b-pawn on the seventh rank supported by its
king. But if White had an a-pawn or a c-pawn instead, the position would be
a draw due to stalemate resources.
13...d1=Q queens the pawn.

* REMEMBER SPACE!
* SPACE ADVANTAGE :-)
http://www.chess.com/chessmentor/view_lesson?id=7074
** It's intuitive that having more space than your opponent constitutes an
advantage. One of the most important aspects of a space advantage is that
you have more room than your opponent to maneuver; the player with a space
disadvantage finds his pieces cramped and unable to keep up with his
opponent's maneuvers. 
---------------------------------------------------------
A quick glance shows that White enjoys a huge space advantage, mostly due
to the blocked pawn chains - where White's is far further advanced than
Black's. Note that the Black queen and rooks can hardly move; the Black
knight can only go on the circuit d8-f7-h8 and back again; and the bishop
can only shuffle behind the pawn chain on the last two ranks. Meanwhile,
White's pieces enjoy total freedom. However, to actually win the game White
needs to attack and win a weak point in Black's position. To this end, you
need to identify Black's weak pawn and send your knight on a maneuver to
attack it. Try to find this maneuver.

** 2
Great job! The b7 pawn - the base of Black's pawn chain - is his only
attackable weakness. Therefore White sends the knight on a trip to a5 to
attack this pawn. Black has three moves to prepare for this, but due to his
extremely cramped position his pieces are not able to arrange an adequate
defense. 

** 3, 4
Unfortunately for Black, freeing the d8 square for his knight on this or
the next move by playing ...Rd7 fails to Ra8, trapping the Black
queen. This is a direct result of his cramped position.

White continues the knight maneuver.
** 5, 6
In preparation for the attack on b7, Black frees the d8 square for the
knight. There is no other way to guard b7, which - if it falls - will cause
Black's whole position to collapse. 

The knight takes aim at b7, and due to Black's cramped position he is
unable to get his pieces in the proper defensive positions in time. 

** 7,8,9
Very good - White breaks through to the base of Black's pawn chain, b7,
using the pin on the 7th rank. The other winning method was 4.Nxb7 Nxb7
5.Ba6, when Black loses material. 

Black has no other option, since his pieces are not able to defend b7, and
if it falls his position will also be hopeless. 

The point of the previous move. White still has not won any material, but
he has invaded the Black position and destroyed the pawn chain - soon
everything will fall apart. 

** 10
White threatened 6.Rxh7. After 5...Nf7 one way (of many) to win is 6.Rb7
Qa8 7.Ra7 Qb8 8.Rxa6, followed by the invasion of White's heavy pieces and
the advance of the passed b-pawn. 
---------------------------------------------------------
White has broken through, but now needs to remove a crucial defender which
will cause the Black position to fall apart immediately. 

** 11
Very good. The knight might have been a sorry piece, but it was the only
thing left holding Black's position together. 

** 12
White captures another pawn and regains the exchange next move due to the
fork. In view of White's two connected passed pawns, which will quickly
advance and win material, Black resigned. This famous example (from a game
by Capablanca) teaches several things about a space advantage: 1) A space
advantage usually results in the cramping of the opponent's pieces; 2) It
is best not to exchange pieces when you have a space advantage; and 3) To
exploit a space advantage you need to find a weakness in your opponent's
position which you can attack. Quite frequently your opponent cannot defend
because his pieces are "tripping over each other" and wrestling each other
for the critical squares.

* http://www.chess.com/chessmentor/view_lesson?id=6496
Count the material and figure out who is ahead in points. Also look for trapped and hanging pieces. A good rule of thumb is to always look for CHECKS and CAPTURES before considering any other moves...and remember to take your time! This is a tricky one!
* satranc http://www.chess.com/chessmentor/view_lesson?id=1686
This is a roughly even endgame in which White has an extra pawn. In many positions, this pawn would be insufficient for a win, but here White has a few advantages. White's pawn provides a useful shield for White's king which allows both White pieces to occupy active squares rather than defend against possible checks. Black, on the other hand, must be careful, as White may have some useful checks against the exposed king.
---------------------------------------------------------
White's extra pawn at e2 does not play an active role in the game, but it is a good defender of the White king. White's knight at g5 is attacked by the Black queen. How can White best meet this nuisance?
** Hint1: Sometimes giving is better than taking in chess.
** Hint2: Your knight wants to move forward, but all good squares are currently protected.
** Hint3: You always want to look at possible captures, no matter how strange they look at first.
In tactical combinations, it is often hardest to find the first move, but when you have recognized or found a pattern, you will be able to find the final position quickly. With more practice, you will begin to see more and more patterns in your games, adding to your positional understanding.

** lesson 1537
For many of you it may seem almost superhuman for someone to be able to see
three, four or five moves ahead in chess. But it's not that hard and you
can do it, too. What experienced players rely upon is a vocabulary of chess
ideas. Each idea might be only one or two moves long. The player then
strings these ideas together constructing longer move sequences. The trick
is in the acquisition of these chess ideas and in making them part of an
active repertoire that you can readily access. It's a little bit like
building up your vocabulary of words. In the learning process you take
words that you have heard of and recognize and turn them into words that
you can use in your everyday speech and writing. The goal of this module
and of Chess Mentor in general is to expose you to a variety of chess ideas
and then to train you to be able to apply them in your games.

1.Nf7 is checkmate! See how the knight can check the king by jumping over
the other Black pieces. The king is in check and has nowhere to move. This
checkmate is called the smothered mate. It's one of the oldest checkmates
dating back to the beginnings of chess over one thousand years ago.  
** lesson 1535
In general, you are supposed to pick a plan of action based on the state of
your pawn structure. The pawn structure delineates whether a position is
closed (the center is blocked by pawns) or open (few center pawns give open
lines for the pieces). The pawn structure also determines whether one's
pieces have good posts available to them or not. Most of all, pawn
structure is thought of (among amateurs) in terms of passed pawns, doubled
pawns, isolated pawns and backward pawns. This problem gives a quick
illustration of each of these pawn types.

The White pawn on a4 is isolated (no other White pawn is on either side of
it or can ever come into contact with it), the White pawn on d5 is passed
(no Black pawn can ever stop its forward progress), the White e-pawns are
doubled (two pawns of the same color are on the same file), and the Black
pawn on b6 is backward. The b6-pawn is unable to move forward, so that it
can stand even with its brother pawns. In general, isolated pawns and
backward pawns are weaknesses. This is especially so if they stand on open
files where they can be attacked by the opponent's rooks. Doubled pawns are
also considered weak, though they have certain virtues which we will
explore in a later problem. Most people consider passed pawns to be
something nice to own, and this problem is devoted to Black stopping the
White passed pawn on d5.
