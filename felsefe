* DO: Listen to Caspar Hare (:-) BE. Observe/Question
Do write up for the next peer-review project!
Just pick up any favorite video..
* From intro to lecture 10 (first of part3 - mind and consciousness)
Re: God and Knowledge and Belief..
Fundamental viewpoint:
I am here and there are "things" outside of me.
Now, can I make sense of what is outside?

Consciousness.. what is it? 
** what is it like to be something?
If something is unconscious, then, we say, there is nothing it's like to be
them..
General property of unconscious things..
Tree, table, stone..
bbx: But, they ARE conscious! (:-) It's only my limited imagination that makes
me feel like at a loss at imagining what it could be like to be a tree..
** wondrous machine (:-)
*** PROBLEM 10.1.1  (1/1 point)
In this lecture, we are focusing on one feature of conscious things ---
that there is something it is like to be them. 

MIT scientists have been working on a wondrous machine. They tell you the following three things:

1- It does not have neurons. 
2- If you try to imagine being it, there is nothing that could make you right. 
3- It is made of copper.

According to Professor Hare, which of the three guarantees that there is
nothing it is like to be the machine? (2, of course :-)

bbx: Note that (2) is not necessarily true: if I can imagine all the laws
of physics controlling me, I would be right.

bbx: each software object is a machine (:-)
the whole universe is a very complex machine that re-programs itself in a
massively parallel and concurrent way while it runs :-)

** Lecture 13.
Baska turlu davranabilir miydi?
Hayir dersem, iradesi olmadigini iddia ediyorum.
   O zaman, ahlaki sorumluluk tasimadigini kabul ediyorum.
Evet dersem, iradesi oldugunu soyluyorum.
   O zaman, ahlaki sorumluluk tasidigini iddia ediyorum.

Ahlaki sorumluluk icin gerek sart irade.
Irade icin gerek sart davrandigimizdan baska turlu davranmamiz olasiligi olmasi.
** Nature is deterministic?
Initial condition + laws of nature -> One possible world?
Incompatibilist theory: if determinism -> could not have done otherwise.
Or -> no free will.
But, same with same reasoning, even if nature is indeterminate, (because in addition to initial conditions + (deterministic) laws of nature, there are indeterministic, micro/atomic level events outside of our control..) -> no free will.
** Does Predictability follow from Determinisim?
Assume: computing with infinite power (space & time).
Are you in (and part of) the system or outside it?? :-)
Frustrating agent: sense the prediction and act otherwise.
Universe is by definition everything. NoThing is outside of it :-)
*** Laplace (1749-1827) thought P = D 
*** Pascal (his wager: better to believe in God! :-)
*** Leibniz vs Newton..
** What does "you could have done it" mean?? [1]
- If you'd wished to do it, then you'd have done it. (free will!) Laws dictate my will or not??
- There was nothing that stood in the way of your doing it. (no obstacle outside)
- It made sense for you to consider it an option. (see it as an option)

** Recap: 
P1: If determinism is true (given initial conditions and laws of nature, there is only one possible world), the universe as it is now is inevitable.
=> If Damien picked the bill, he could not have done otherwise.
P2: If he could not have done otherwise, he is NOT morally responsible.
C: He is NOT morally responsible.

P1 is questionable. There is no univocal interpretation for "could not have done otherwise" which is true for two pre-suppositions:
PP1: He could not have changed the laws of nature.
PP2: He could not have changed the initial conditions.
See [1] above.
** New argument (from Harry Frankfurt)
P2 is a bad premise (principle of alternate possibilities) 
P2 revised: Not morally responsible if other things guarantee that you could not have done otherwise.
Frankfurt case 1: Anna & Beth. An odious deed.
Fractious relationship..
Anna thinks Beth is loved more by mom.
Letter from mom after she dies.. says, she loved them both equally.
Beth burns the letter.
Case 2: Introduce, the third evil sister, Eve..
Eve says "I will kill you, Beth, if you do not burn that letter or if you tell Anna about it."
Morally responsible, because she wanted to. But, she could not have done otherwise, either..
Counter example to principle of alternate "good" possibilities:
You are morally responsible for doing something only if you had other "good" options.
Case 3: Remote intervention device that can be used to control Beth's brain.
Counter example to principle of no alternate possibilities..
So, Frankurt says, we can be morally responsible in a deterministic universe..
But, what if my "wants" are also determined by the universe??
