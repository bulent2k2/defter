Homework 4

Here are the instructions for submitting HW4. Submission will be similar to HW3. You will submit a .tar.gz file with various directories of your app:

    app/
    config/
    db/migrate
    features/
    spec/
    Gemfile

If you modified any other files, please include them too. If you are using the Virtual Machine, navigate to the root directory for HW4 and run

tar czf hw4.tar.gz app/ config/ db/migrate features/ spec/ Gemfile

This will create the file hw4.tar.gz, which you will submit. Please note that the auto-grader may take longer than usual. If it takes more than several minutes, try refreshing the page.

Feature: search for movies by director
  
  As a movie buff
  So that I can find movies with my favorite director
  I want to include and serach on director information in movies I enter

  Background: movies in database      # features/search_by_director.feature:7
    Given the following movies exist: # features/step_definitions/movie_steps.rb:1
      | title        | rating | director     | release_date |
      | Star Wars    | PG     | George Lucas | 1977-05-25   |
      | Blade Runner | PG     | Ridley Scott | 1982-06-25   |
      | Alien        | R      |              | 1979-05-25   |
      | THX-1138     | R      | George Lucas | 1971-03-11   |

  Scenario: add director to existing movie                # features/search_by_director.feature:16
    When I go to the edit page for "Alien"                # features/search_by_director.feature:17
      Ambiguous match of "I go to the edit page for "Alien"":

      features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:48:in `/^(?:|I )go to (.+)$/'
      
      You can run again with --guess to make Cucumber be more smart about it
       (Cucumber::Ambiguous)
      features/search_by_director.feature:17:in `When I go to the edit page for "Alien"'
    And I fill in "Director" with "Ridley Scott"          # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:60
    And I press "Update Movie Info"                       # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:52
    Then the director of "Alien" should be "Ridley Scott" # features/search_by_director.feature:20
      Undefined step: "the director of "Alien" should be "Ridley Scott"" (Cucumber::Undefined)
      features/search_by_director.feature:20:in `Then the director of "Alien" should be "Ridley Scott"'

  Scenario: find movie with same director                       # features/search_by_director.feature:22

      Can't find mapping from "the details page for "Star Wars"" to a path.
      Now, go and add a mapping in /tmp/hw4_grader20121105-15067-b4b9sp/features/support/paths.rb (RuntimeError)

      features/search_by_director.feature:23:in `Given I am on the details page for "Star Wars"'
    When I follow "Find Movies With Same Director"              # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:56
    Then I should be on the Similar Movies page for "Star Wars" # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:230
    And I should see "THX-1138"                                 # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:105
    But I should not see "Blade Runner"                         # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:123

  Scenario: can't find similar movies if we don't know director (sad path) # features/search_by_director.feature:29
    Given I am on the details page for "Alien"                             # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:44
      Can't find mapping from "the details page for "Alien"" to a path.
      Now, go and add a mapping in /tmp/hw4_grader20121105-15067-b4b9sp/features/support/paths.rb (RuntimeError)
      ./features/support/paths.rb:32:in `rescue in path_to'

    And I should see "'Alien' has no director info"                        # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:105

Failing Scenarios:
cucumber features/search_by_director.feature:16 # Scenario: add director to existing movie

3 scenarios (3 failed)
17 steps (3 failed, 10 skipped, 1 undefined, 3 passed)

You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Then /^the director of "([^"]*)" should be "([^"]*)"$/ do |arg1, arg2|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
