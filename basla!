* business plan canvas

This educational component of Flashpoint is critical, but the real task confronting each founder was to fill in all the blank spaces of his or her “business model canvas.” The colors they used were neither oil nor acrylic, but rather informational—answers to the many questions that confront anyone looking to bring a new business idea to market: Who are your customers, and what value do you bring them? How do they find out about you? What relationship do you have with them? What resources do you bring together to make this happen—did you build a database? Who are your partners? What do they want, and what do you provide?

“When your business is running, you’ll know all these answers, but at the beginning you don’t,” Furst says. “The process of engineering a startup is the process of intentionally and efficiently bounding uncertainties and risk, the net result of which is validated discovery of opportunity. Once you have that, it’s something people can fund, something they can come work for, something you can build into a business.

“Focusing on that very early stage,” he says, “is what startup engineering is all about.”
