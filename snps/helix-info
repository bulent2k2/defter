* Helix terminology, questions
UCell := constraint (owns insts/subcells) -- hierarchical constraint group
Helix constraint schema
Helix Constraint Compiler 
YAML description in *.hxcs file
Input consistency checking
PNStackUCell S-expression goes into the *.hxdsn file.
Helix.exe has DesignBuilder class -> reads the PNStackUCell S-expression, and gathers all the parameters specified by the user.
Helix “cloning”: allows the user to “copy” a constraint hierarchy for a set of “source” sub-cells onto a set of “target” sub-cells. Helix is supposed to produce identical topological arrangements for both sets of sub-cells.
sub-cell := inst
** PN stack
"sub-row stacking"?
twell? (well tap?)
PRow and NRow are dictionaries
OverlapLayer rules can be defined in AllowedGroup, layers between the subCells in the same allowedGroup will be excluded when checking the spacing.
