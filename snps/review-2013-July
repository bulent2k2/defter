* Product not mature. Not many customers..
Too many tweaks...
* Future (see today!): 
Had a good discussion with Girish re: system level integration with sbr and
helix to identify and implement big changes, and integration with auto-fix
 to separate design intent from DRC. (3 hour + discussion with Girish. Re: editing on abstract visualization, abstracting wires, integration w/ auto-fix sbr and helix, to separate design intent from drc, incremental routing (drc) and incremental placement (manual))

* Re-writing of major modules:
  airdb chem-a generation
    Move from VF to GSP
    direct link from mols to db objects
  hflow
    hbond generation
    hierarchy creation
    via generation
  via array creation
  path creation
  net/pin/text preservation
  pcell flow
* New modules
  Tile plane based selection of mols (2012.10)
  Higher level interface for custom bonds (Jbond api) (2012.10)
  {alx define purpose}
  {alx sdl map}
* Enhancements
  Abstract cell feature (productized). Faster and more general migration. (2012.10)
  Improvements to pcell flow: (inst name preservation, handle dummy devices, auto pcell detection, improved abutment handling)
  Enable CCI flow to run on sub-cell (BIAS)
  Enhance CDL mapping to handle R and C
* 2013.03 and .06
  MPP/Path preservation
  Symmetry under non-uniform resizing (device, abstract and wire)
  Pcell inst preservation
  Wiring QoR
  New Hierarchy Flow and QoR (0 via pop-ups in STARC top!)
  SDL compliance, cross-probing {alx sdl map} 
  Area/compaction
  Runtime improvements ({alx migrate} and {alx run pcell}) More than 2x. 4x on STARC top cell.
  native OA mode
  Save/restore
  Abstract flow improvements {alx map abstract pins|shapes}
* > 150 unit tests (cvs test)
From 60 on beginning of 2012 (cvs checkout -D 20120101 test/alx)
* On going
  Laker integration
