* R&D review and release planning work
I suggest we start with STARC commitments, check where we are, and then tie them into the release plan:

•	2012-11-23
1.	2727	mohit		alx! generate path produces strange result on pcell library	
2.	2632	mohit		path generation in tutorial is reporting various invalid (?) warnings and not all paths…	
3.	2762	bulent		PCell params not getting re-evaluated when DFM options are 
4.	2772	shakir		make sure power rails do not overlap 
5.	2690	bulent		pcell result has duplicate nets
6.	2741	shakir		keep power lines (vdd/vss) same width as input 

•	2012-11-30
7.	2770	sunil		Loss of gate contacts and m1 on poly straps for 

•	2012-12-07
8.	2764	shakir		shielded signal wire no longer shielded in 
9.	2771	shakir		Replace current abstracts with STARC provided cap 
10.	2773	shakir		long overlapping m5/m6 wires no longer overlapping in lay-
11.	2774	shakir		use pcell resistor contacts instead of leaving original ones 
12.	2766	sunil		symmetry loss in matched device wire 

•	2012-12-14
13.	2742	bulent		create separate instances for dummy fingers with specific 
14.	2752	shakir		auto instance correspondence between sch and lay does not work in 
15.	2768	sunil		Fat m2 straps on source/drain connections of matched 

•	2013-01-11
16.	2747	mohit		Covert MPP to fig-group and preserve fig-group in ALX output	
17.	2708	mohit		symmetry loss in matched 

•	2013-01-31 
18.	2761	mohit		symmetry needs to be maintained for abstracts

•	2013-02-18
19.	2744	sunil		new mode checked in [new Chem_A in Hierarchical…]

And here is the release plans from Sumit to remind us 

Specs Complete	Feature Freeze		Code Freeze	Release to Ops	
11/29 			1/5			2/5  		3/5	

Synopsys Feature freeze actually is Titan (development style) code-freeze. Between feature freeze and code-freeze in Synopsys one is supposed to be doing QA, adding regressions and fixing QA reported issues. Between Code-freeze and Release to Ops code goes to CAEs for Beta testing and fixing of issues reported by them. 

So when someone asks for a commitment on release please take end of nov date for specs and early Jan for code-completion. Please clearly state/clarify the assumption you are making on what time frame (for coding) you have in mind for the commitment.

Let us avoid any confusion on this account.

Let’s discuss our tentative release plan in order to:
1-	clarify the spec (the problem we want to solve, NOT how to solve it)
2-	come up with effort/time estimates

• PCell migration
o	preserve/map pcells in the input, ensure SDL compliance, splitting of dummy fingers, pcell abutment, finger symmetry, nets
• Wiring QoR
o	eliminate antennas, hashed rectangles, smart hbonds, jog re-ordering, inter-layer ordering/alignment, power-rail specs (fixed pitch, device avoidance)
• Auto symmetry preservation under non-uniform sizing
• Path/MPP preservation
• Performance improvements
• Stretch goals
o 	Usability (CRs: 2686, 2694, 2754, 2721, 2726, 2719, 2720, 2722)
o 	Hflow QoR
o 	ALX on TitanOA
o 	tsmc28 (phase 3)
• Risks or dependencies?
