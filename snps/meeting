* No meeting with Shing-Te on Sep 18 (routing offsite) and 25 (managers meeting)

- Update on prototyping/experiments                         Shakir/Bulent

Reviewed: 1- SBR experiments so far, 2- hi-level spec for the prototype. We expect that the prototyping will have a few phases. The objectives are two-fold: - fast migration, - fast rule/pdk setup. To achieve these, we will rely on the following:
a) Bottom-up fast abstract run
b) Short wires to be delegated to SBR
c) Cookie-cut to clean-up abstract interfaces
d) Hierarchical routing (Renlin has some script?)
e) pcell inst routing (in the first phase, rely on pcell params, e.g., Sato's pdk)
