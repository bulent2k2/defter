* Proposal to integrate ALX into Zandro Platform

* Motivation

Laker LE is the best-of-class in the industry. There is a significant opportunity to solidify and extend this lead by incorporating ALX technology into Laker.

* What can LE do with ALX?

Our customers have three pain points that ALX technology helps alleviate. In reverse order in the design cycle: 
1- Implementation of ECOs in layout (latest stages, prior to tape-out)
2- Design iterations (mid-cycle, design convergence)
3- Re-use of existing layout to solve new problems (early-on, design planning/tech readiness)

Today, ECOs in AMSG/custom layout are mostly implemented manually. The following are a few examples of costly, and sometimes even prohibitive changes:
- Increasing size of a driver, 
- Reducing the current density on a signal node, 
- Improving signal integrity of a bus with shield or space insertion

Today, re-use of analog/custom layout is mostly manual. State-of-the-art (i.e., existing tools) suffers from two major issues:
x- subcell proliferation
y- costly rule/pdk setup

Design iterations are too many and too slow. This is primarily due to the cost of creating and changing quality interconnect. Analog routers are still in infancy.

* How?

ALX will:
a- maximize re-use of layout, and
b- minimize time to good layout.

It does this by:
1- re-use what is valuable to the user, leave the rest to the router
2- rely on PDK to produce good device layout (pcells)
3- focusing on design intent, and leave complex DRC to auto-fix
4- heavy abstraction to enable fast chip-level re-use

* x is addressed with 4
* y is addressed with combo of 1,2 and 3
* a is addressed with combo of 1,2 and 4
* b is addressed with combo of 1,3 and 4
