[+] MS3 run-time (Helix only) down to 8 hours (full hier run) from 19h. Trick: New layout only hier.. Can probably go down to 4h fairly easily...
* 2015 03 09

Summary:
  [+] Nvidia: Updated the dashboard and sent out to the stakeholders. Communicated with George about the latest status. He will be back on Friday. On MS3, reduced runtime from 19h to about 10h. Hit an issue after updating the netlist, and resolved after getting a very good hint from Mirko. Thanks!

  [+] Maxwell/PNStack: Created two new STARs: STAR: 9000870236- PNStack: automation for row count params, STAR: 9000870110- PNStack (and all other constraints using AVP) to support -r (dry-run) mode.

  [+] Altera: Created STAR: 9000869568 (Object to layer mapping in DRC Script for Santana.tech) and had brief communication with Siarhei on it.

  [+] Intel DTS: Asked a few questions to Jose to help refine the specs. 


Plan:
  [-] Nvidia: Continue to improve runtime/floor-plan and DRCs in MS3

* 2015 02 23

Summary:
  [+] Had a very good trip to MV with productive visits to customers (Intel DTS, NVidia and Altera), as well as internal R&D meetings (and a yummy buffet to celebrate the Chinese New Year!)
 
Intel:
  [+] Visited Intel DTS on site and gave a demo of hi-level symmetry and ECO placement features. It was very well received by Intel representatives. Also, we helped clarify expected flow and usage of the new features.
 
Nvidia:
  [+] Met Swathi (AC @ Nvidia) for the first time. She was very helpful with introductions to Nvidia, setting up meetings with Sriram and Tuan Do. Thanks!
  [+] Met with Tuan to understand the requirements he had on the test-case. Gave him a quick intro to various aspects of Helix.
  [+] Earlier, created a separate (and third) StructuredPartition in Tuan's test-case to achieve alignment of m3 pre-routes.
 
Altera:
  [+] Met Lyndon at Altera and confirmed good alignment on device placement problem/style between Intel ICF and Altera.
  [+] 10nm requests: Had good brainstorming meetings with various team members. Came up with various proposals and rough effort estimates for cell and device placement requests.
  [+] Tested new block placement functionality. Created STAR: 9000864570- Column constraint with CustomSpacing/CorrectAfterForDRC has DR violations
  [+] Tested the GUI support and identified two issues. Informed Prashant. Amrish promptly fixed them both.
  [+] For the previous line item, created STAR: 9000863784- Enhance GUI for CustomSpacing: add new param CorrectAfterForDRC
 
Maxwell:
  [+] Reviewed and updated: STAR: 9000856031- Partition re-use not support ContactRing
  [+] Reviewed and updated: STAR: 9000860338- Partition not warn that sym pair not "matched" layout
 
Misc.
  [+] One day holiday on Monday
 
Plan:
  [-] (Maxwell) Review UCM on PNStack and (Packed)Partition
  [-] Validate fixes to 9000863784 and 9000864570
  [-] Provide content for release notes.

* 2015 02 16

Intel
  [+] Prepared for the demo with new test-cases for ECO. Also encountered a few issues and had various conversations w/ Joe (re: OrientationTransform, negative coordinates, frozen pcells, etc.).
 
Nvidia
  [+] Provided a status update to Glenn T.
  [+] Did a fresh new MS3 run with the latest constraints for the whole design hierarchy using the latest TECH dir (from Girish/Siarhei). Used  the "Big" config of LSF to do one full run. Took about 19 hours (compare to first run with long rows: 3 days!). The bad news is we have work to do to look into and resolve all the DRCs (about 90k :-()). But, I hope most of them are caused by my quick and dirty manual constraints.
  [+] Learned more of git (and loving it more and more!), cloned the latest constraints, created a branch to capture latest run..
  [+] Created two git branches to capture MS3 results to date: Ross's result with long rows and the latest result with manually improved constraints (to replace long rows with Partition/Pattern/Matrix/etc.).
  [+] Filled the table to be sent to Ashkan to transfer data to SNPS. But, first untarred the one big file and eliminated duplication.
  [+] Created a snapshot of the latest constraints for MS3 (git commit).
 
Maxwell
  [+] Started reading/reviewing the UCM fspec document (only more than 300 pages or so :-).
 
Misc.
  [+] Ran pnstack regressions in berry farm to help investigate regression failures there. There are some new drcs. Thanks to Siarhei for help with debug. 
  [+] Reading and playing with "git." What a wonderful software tool to help create software tools :-)!
  [+] Reading a tutorial on "constraint programming" from CMU.
  [+] The SSD drive in my laptop had gotten a lot worse with many more blue screens and large data files getting corrupted a lot more often (Outlook, OneNote, etc..). IT sent me a loaner which is working out great :-). How easy it has gotten to move on to a new machine! Sent back to IT mine for them to plug in a new SSD.
 
Plan:
  [-] Visit to MV, Nvidia and Intel DTS.
  [-] Provide content for release notes.
  [-] Help tweak test-case to help test the new block-placement mode better.
  [-] Write feedback for season of reviews.
  [-] Compare DRC status of first two MS#3 results

Intel/Maxwell
  [+] Prepared a demo test-case for sym (basic test with two sym axes). Encountered some issues and informed Joe who promptly improved results.
  [+] Had some fspec discussion with Joe on sym group flipping/rotation (wrong focus), overlap-layer param per group (not needed).
  [+] Marked fixed: STAR 9000816479- Intel ICF requests (tracking November, 2014 delivery)
  [+] Had a brief conversation with Prashant on re-use with hard vs soft macros (layout vs topology).

Nvidia
  [+] Investigating the new layout to see where it needs to be improved.
  [+] Marked a STAR fixed. As it is already addressed by Siarhei and Girish. STAR: 9000847419- nVidia ms3 - various kinds of design rule violations
  [+] Marked "Need further review": STAR: 9000847418- nVidia ms3 - Helix reports "internal pitch rule violatio

Altera
  [+] Created a unit test-case to help Yakov test the enhancement to solve the "block-placement" problem (using DRC correction on custom spacing). Without the new enhancement, it currently has min-spacing errors between "blocks". QA team could take this test-case and proliferate it to test the feature extensively.
  [+] Tested eng build manually in berryfarm to confirm that the matrix test-case (2014-07-17/case2) worked ok (boundary layer shape created by finish script is longer aligned with origin).
  [+] Updated log and reassigned to Yakov: STAR 9000828626- CustomSpacing EnforceDesignRules option to support Include/ExcludeLayers

Misc./Meetings
  [+] Switched from csh to bash (long overdue, but better late than never! :-), and converted my big bad build setup script and a few other utilities (aliases, etc) to bash as well.
  [+] Meetings: Triage, ...

* 2014 02 02

Nvidia
  [+] SOW#3: Finally, got the first result for "el gordo", the humongous circuit band-gap core, with a reasonable layout quality. The main challenge was figuring out the issue with PNP22 (bipolar transistor) cell. In HFL output, it was grouped into a VMATRIX. I had changed it to a PATTERN, to help speed up the run. However, it was giving an error after a long run time. Upon "Preview Pattern", it was also giving an error much faster (:-). Mirko tried to help (Thanks!). However, the netlist compiler configuration was correct. The problem was due to a bug in Pattern constraint, I think. The ElementType was set to device. Changed it (in .hxcs, as it is read-only in GUI) to macro. The run went through. 
  [+] Also spent some time partitioning the large row/vpattern (with 5k elements!) into smaller Patterns. This resulted in a partition of 11 patterns. The total runtime for el gordo is just shy of 2 days. The rest of the circuits, including the top-block do not take more than a few hours at most. 
  [+] A quick look at the layout shows a lot of promise (much better than the first result with looong rows). Will try to improve the run-time further first and then refine the constraints..
  [+] Compiled the data we need transfered for SOW data/work and created one tar file.
  [+] Looked for the 10nm tech data in nvidia incoming data as per Siarhei's request. Thanks to Ashish for providing the path to PDK..
  [+] Looked into VDR discrepancy in ross's area. Also ran drc on Ross's result. There were many violations including VDR rules in that run, too.

Intel/SP1 release/Maxwell
  [+] Helped Joe multipleExpansionParam for cnnet2hx. Debugged and fixed his test-case.
  [+] Responded many good question from QA team thanks to their good testing of the brand-new hi-level symmetry and ECO features.
  [+] Looked into three regression failures. Results were good. Seems to be a problem with the harness.
 
Altera
  [+] Lyndon agreed to the interface for "block-placement" support. I looked into coming up with a test-case as per Yakov's request. However, as per Siarhei, there is no test-case @snps with a modular (block) grid. Therefore, I am trying to re-use some of the test-cases from Lyndon in Berryfarm. Work in progress.

Plan
  [-] Improve layout and run-time for SOW#3 test-case
  [-] Set up a test-case for block placement mode in berry

* 2014 01 26

Altera
  [+] Various good conversations/meetings regarding finish script vs origin shifting (STAR: 9000777674- Matrix does not support AlignBoundaryLayersToAxes()). There were two separate issues confusing the matters and they are both fixed now. Earlier, spent some time to investigate further the data in berry and the related code.
  [+] Updated and re-opened STAR: 9000828623- New placement mode to enforce design and mod-grid rules ("block" placement). 
  [+] Looked into merge-able layers. They seem to be hard-coded to "nwellLayer, pwellLayer, twellLayer, od2Layer, rpoLayer." Yakov confirmed, but he also stated that with coding other layers could be added. Also updated the STAR to capture this..
  [+] Attended the altera meeting and provided an overview of Intel ICF DTC flow.
  [+] Checked with Lyndon to confirm that overlap-layers and block-placement mode will be exclusive. I.e., when block-placement mode is turned on, overlap-layers will have no effect.

nVidia
  [+] Received a new test-case from Swathi (from Memory? team). Girish and Mirko have worked on it. I looked at the test-case and tried to run DRC on the latest result, but got a failure due to missing layer definition. Siarhei helped with a new santana.tech. Thanks to all!
  [+] Did more runs on MS3. I think the key message is that a significant portion (many or most) of these DRCs are due to (internal to) the primitives. So, nothing Helix could do about. We will continue to investigate..
  [+] Inspected the sub-cell results in ms3. Identified various long rows causing the results to be unacceptable. Converted them to *pattern, *matrix.
  [+] On the largest sub-cell, Helix gives an error due to a missing cell (PNP22) after a 3-hour run time. However, pyros can open the cell. Captured test-case and communicated to team members. Fortunately, we can reproduce the problem instantenously with Pattern's Preview feature!

Intel/SP1 release/Maxwell
  [+] Updated the hi-level fspec slides with details on params and behaviors for symmetry and ECO. 
  [+] Had a coversation with Joe to go over the details of PlaceGroup param.
  [+] Put together a rough test-plan to help the QA team start testing.
  [+] Also created a basic test for ECO placement. However, it exposed a few issues. Filed a new STAR: 9000852448- Partition with a frozen group takes too long for multiple results.
  [+] Started reviewing slides on sed vs pattern constraint (as per Kumar's request)

Misc
  [+] One day ETO on last Monday
  [+] I looked into three failed regression runs. Work in progress.
  [+] Season of reviews..
  [+] Had various outlook crashes (both outlook and owa), blue screens earlier (and later) in the week. Fortunately, owa from int.synopsys.com worked (:-). Probably, have a bad SSD.. IT wants to order a new one.. Also, my cell phone (with the soft token on it) died today. Thankfully, IT gave me a loaner/emergency token that is valid for a day or two!

Plan
  [-] Look into regression failures
  [-] Investigate issues on ms3 and new test-case (nVidia)

* Review 2015 01 19
Title: R&D Engineer, Sr Staff
Grade: 69
Years in Current Position: 2.8
** SUMMARY OF PERFORMANCE

In the first half of the year, Bulent mostly focused on AVP-based features (PNStack and PackedPartition). He has engaged with the customers to help clarify requirements, ramped up on Helix architecture, code and harness to help architect solutions, write functional-specs and create unit-test cases to initiate test-driven implementation of critical features such as: abutment, density/LDE, gridding, MatchDeviceOrientation,sub-row, nwell bridging, flat-macro, oaCellBoundary, OverlapPRBoundary, halo, orientationTransform, enableFlip/Rotation, etc. He has helped with the delivery of various engineering builds to both Altera and Intel. All PNStack issues raised by Altera have been resolved. Intel has also been satisfied by the quality of results from PackedPartition.

In the second half, Bulent switched focus to activities with a wider scope in Helix such as template-based flow, device tile/template configuration based placement and topology re-use (for Intel ICF), high-level symmetry and incremental placement/ECO support (for Intel DTS), block-placement mode (for Altera), layout acceleration in Maxwell with Helix and AVP.

Bulent has put more focus and priority on helping the team dynamics and communication by providing technical leadership among factions in the team colleborating with team members in Austin, Mountain View, Canada, India and England. Nevertheless, he has also accomplished a variety of coding tasks, not only many code reviews, but also enhancement and bug fixing. E.g., SiteExtension enhancement to provide multi-level/hierarchical menus for actions and templates (C++), enhancements in constraint compiler (python), etc.
** GOAL FOR THE COMING YEAR
The coming year will be critical for our team to integrate Helix/AVP into Maxwell not only as a set of features, but also as a seamless and mission critical value add on top of the base platform. Bulent can help architect and implement solutions to help automate template-based constraint generation for not only analog, but also custom digital circuits.

Bulent will also need to drive the co-development effort with nVidia to ensure that SOW milestones are met and continue to engage both Altera and Intel DTS to help drive the on-going projects to successful closure.
** DEVELOPMENT PLAN
Bulent needs to continue to ramp up on CD architecture, flows and code. His expertise in C++ and TCL will help. But, his main focus should be technical leadership with architecting solutions, drafting functional specifications and implementation specifications.

Clean up of the schema for PackedPartition and PNStack to remove unspecified/unused options
  [+] Prepared a large mixed analog/custom-digital test-case (from a
  high-speed SERDES RX block) named GTO. Created constraints for the whole
  block. For the top-cell, observed a 4-hour run time for a partition
  constraint (with 13 elements).

* 2014 01 12
nVidia
  [+] Reviewed the new setup details on pcell xtreme and communicated to nVidia. Thanks to Prashant and Ming for the pointers.
  [+] Updated weekly dashboard/slides for nvidia and sent them out
  [+] Did some runs on ms3 test-case. Observed various subcells with internal pitch rule violation, long-run times and DRC. Later did a new git clone on ms3. No longer getting fin_grid and internal pitch violations on the smaller sub-cell. Thanks to Siarhei for doing a fresh run on his side. Did a diff between the two check-outs. Could not find anything that would explain the difference in results. However, some of the larger sub-cells still report internal pitch violation. Need to reproduce on a small subcell and update the STAR.
  [+] Filed two stars to track some of the issues in the first run:
      STAR: 9000847419- nVidia ms3 - various kinds of design rule violations
      STAR: 9000847418- nVidia ms3 - Helix reports "internal pitch rule violation"
  [+] On ms3, one of the top sub-blocks is very large and has a large Pattern (with >1000 fingers). It can not even be previewed due to std::exception. Will file a STAR
  [+] Worked on the a sample test-case from nVidia on samsung 14. Debugged and fixed some env issues
      1- pdk_v3 used in setupenv script but not available for sams14. Fixed by adding a soft link to existing pdk
      2- Got ...Word too long error from helix_12012014/quickstart/tcshrc. This was due to polluted env. Solution is to unsetenv PYTHONPATH and OA_PLUGIN_PATH before sourcing setupenv..

Altera
  [+] Had discussions with Yakov on altera requests/issues. The good news is that we are in sync on the desired functionality for block-placement mode. Yakov also pointed out that using the CustomSpacing API will save us significant amount of implementation cost.

PNStack
  [+] STAR activity:
    [.] STAR: 9000714805 (Regression case STAR/9000667192 is failing with
    overlapped placement): Tested with latest build. It worked ok. No
    failure. Marked Fixed and re-assigned to Ellen.

    [.] STAR: 9000719129 (PNStack - Enhance constraint compiler to catch
    various/common exceptions): Specific STARs exists and are linked to
    this STAR. There are 7 STARs that cover all known exceptions. 4 are
    fixed. Marked this one Fixed and re-assigned to Ross.

    [.] Updated various STARs that I haved fixed in the past to re-assign
     them to QA/CAE for Fix Validation.

  [+] Had good discussions with teammates on symmetry, alignment,
  sub-groups in PackedPartition, etc.. 

  [+] Started investigations for the STAR on CC for PNStack
  auto-assignment. Postponed in light of priority changes. 

GUI
  [+] Merge code from main into 2013.12 branch: CL#41428: Merged CL#41397

* 2014 07 21
GUI
  [+] Coded and checked in an enhancement for STAR 9000769259 (constraint
  unbound device errors with SITE_EXENSIONS support). Site (extension)
  constraint support is enhanced to bring up the "Execute Template" form, if
  there are generic ($DEVICE) devices in the selected hxtmpl. Also noticed,
  during reading existing code, that CustomConstraint suffers from the same
  issue. Need to discuss with teammates to figure out the spec for it.

  [+] Merged my earlier GUI fix for STAR 9000755683 (multi-level menu
  support in SITE_EXENSIONS) from branch to main. Integrated CL# 41221 to
  main with CL#41392). 


Altera/nVidia/PNStack
  [+] Did some testing for PNStack changes to validate the STAR
  fixes (9000770610). Found an issue which Joe fixed promptly.

  [+] Did more study on the new GTO test-case. PackedPartition reduced run
  time from 4h to 2h. Column took about 40 minutes. Switching from VMatrix to
  Matrix improved runtime significantly from 40m to only 6min!

  [+] Created/Filed: STAR 9000770610 Replace PNStack FixDimension param 
  with MinRows/MaxRows options


Intel/PackedPartition 
  [+] Read the slides on new requirements from Intel

  [+] Had various discussion on Intel requirements, symmetry, DRC, etc.

* 2014 06 30 (since 2014 06 16)
GUI
  [+] Enhanced Site Extension functionality to organize actions and
  templates into hierarchical (cascading or multi-level) menus based on the
  site-extension directory structure: STAR 9000755683 (multi-level menu
  support in SITE_EXENSIONS). Checked it into the 2013.12 branch before the
  code freeze deadline. Tested the new code on the nightly build and also
  on Ellen's testcase. It works fine. This was a good opportunity to get
  familiar with the GUI code and the Qt library.

  [+] Investigated STAR 9000769259 (constraint unbound device errors with
  SITE_EXENSIONS support). It looks like the template parser is missing the
  generic device names. Need to debug further.

Altera/nVidia/PNStack
  [+] Prepared a large mixed analog/custom-digital test-case (from a
  high-speed SERDES RX block) named GTO. Created constraints for the whole
  block. For the top-cell, observed a 4-hour run time for a partition
  constraint (with 13 elements). It generated 46 solutions. The runtime
  complexity is high due to, I am guessing, the number of solutions for
  sub-ucells like VMatrix. It could be a good test-case for the new
  thinning enhancement.

  [+] Had some discussions with Joe and Ming to help spec out contact ring
  functionality for abutted PRows in multi-row support. 

  [+] Had some discussions with team mates on allowed types/groups in
  PNStack.

Altera/nVidia/PNStack
  [+] Last week, I continued investigating potential enhancements for the next phase of PNStack. I also started the write-up for the functional spec document. Planning to finish it up and publish it early this week for review.
  [+] Investigated and had discussions about replacing FixDimension control with MinRows/MaxRows. Looks very promising. It ss now a part of the f-spec.
  [+] Had discussions and converged on 9000758017- PNStack to throw error upon infeasibility instead of auto-correcting the spec.
  [+] Continued experimenting with SPP and filed another STAR: 9000759082- PNStack diagnostic message on PNSpacing is inaccurate.
  [+] Validated fix for two recent STARs: 9000758017, 9000758083.

** write-up
Altera/nVidia/PNStack
  [+] Great progress this week on running StructuredPartition on PNStacks
  (SPP) on a variety of design scenarios. As such, we can now automate
  large custom digital blocks without having to wait for manual creation of
  library cells. Please note that we have already tested the SPP support
  for various combinations of scenarios:
    [.] With or without well/substrate taps (guard rings with contacts)
    [.] With flat devices (in PNStacks) or macro-cells (created with PNStacks)

  [+] Worked on testing PNStack with new pcell extreme (skill eval) code.

Intel/PackedPartition
  [+] No update this week.

Other
  [+] Read a couple of SNUG papers on Helix.

Plan
  [-] Communicate latest results on SPP to Ross and get further feedback.
  [-] File a few STARs to record a few issues I have encountered on PNStack
  [-] Re-test PNStack using Prashant's test-case after disabling wrappers.
  [-] Study santana python tutorial and some finish scripts
  [-] Investigate STARs on PP
  [-] Updates to the packed partition spec to incorporate more feedback

  [-] Course requirements from SNPS University

** Details only for me (:-)
  [+] Communicated the latest results to Ross. He pointed out that nwell
  sharing could be improved further. Did further investigation on that
  front. Found out that we have two pcell params of interest in this PDK:
  shrinkNW and superShrinkNW. Turning them on thru the pass-through
  mechanism, I was able to get a very compact placement. Will communicate
  to Ross for further feedback. One question to investigate: do we need to
  support PDK's without this feature?

  [+] Investigated implementation options on STAR 9000752525 and had good
  discussions with Joe. The current solution we converged on is arguably
  not optimal -- it uses existing Dummy layer in Helix -- however, it is a
  good middle ground to help us proceed and explore further ground until we
  figure out a more ideal solution.

  [+] Had some discussions on nwell sharing, left/right boundary edge
  optimization. Did some testing with manually added nwell island. All
  nwell/tap/contact/latchup errors are now clean. Only have a few M1 area,
  and density (PO/OD/M1) violations.

  [+] Tested the fix for STAR: 9000752525 and marked it Fix Validated.

  [+] Did some testing for CL#40939 -- the fix for STAR 9000752471 for cell
  height w/o contact rings. Failed for me. Also got an assert failure on a
  sub-cell. Joe promptly fixed both. Verified and marked the STAR "Fix
  Verified." 

  [+] Earlier this week, I manually created cell boundary for PNStack
  generated macros. Used auto-generate option in CD. Then modified them so
  that they go thru the centerline of the contacts arrays at the top and
  bottom. That makes StdPart work even with default value for
  AbutmentBoundary, PRBoundary. It nicely shares the contact arrays,
  however, we get DRC due to partially overlapped (off-grid) cuts. This
  also helped identify the more general solution that we need to compute
  left/right edges of PRBoundary to also go thru the centerlines of
  contacts.

  [+] Earlier in the week, I put together a basic test for PNStack by
  modifying the test-case from Prashant to test abutment on new Pcell
  Xtreme code for skill pcells. I was able to compile the
  constraint, but hit a seg fault. It was already fixed by Prashant, but, I
  had only an old build in JP, the testing environment (from April
  17). Prashant kindly provided the latest build which I was able to use to
  run PNStack. This helped confirm that for the simple 4 device CMOS, we
  get good abutment and clean DRC (except for min M1 area violations which
  is expected and not a problem). However, further investigation showed
  that this test-case is missing some manual modification due to which it
  still has PyCell wrappers. I will next go through that additional setup
  to test without the wrappers. Thanks to Prashant for help with the
  details.
* 2014 05 19
Altera/nVidia/PNStack
  [+] I have been investigating the PNStack improvements we have chosen to
  focus on in our discussions with Ross. The main objective is to enable
  full automation of custom digital subckts using a StdPartition of
  PNStacks. This speeds up the design flow for AMS designers because they
  do not need to wait for manual layout work before they can run
  StdPartition (or ICC).

  [+] Filed two STARs that prevents us from using StdPartition of
  PNStacks. They represent two basic and distinct scenarios: One with
  top/bottom contact arrays (STAR 9000752525), and the other without (STAR
  9000752471).

  [+] Finally nailed down the discrepancy between the test-cases of
  StdPartition of PNStacks (The first one is originally from Ross. The
  second is a modification of the first by Mirko.) The main culprit is the
  "AbutmentBoundary" option in StdPartition. By default, it is set to use
  "PRBoundary." The default fails to work with a mix of flat and sub-macro
  PNStacks. However, when we set AbutmentBoundary to "device," it works,
  even without top-cell shape option and and CustomConstruction on the flat
  PNStack. Please see STAR 9000752525 for more details.

  [+] Built/tested Joe's new fix (CL# 40818) for STAR: 9000748424. The
  result was improved, but did not get the NPPN pattern (instead got
  NPN). Later, also built/tested CL#40829 which does a better job.

  [+] Attended the meetings with Altera's Lyndon. Later had discussions
  with Joe where I described the new PNStack needs from Altera.

  [+] Had discussions with Joe and Ming regarding PNStack vision/plans and
  priorities.

Intel/PackedPartition
  [+] No update this week.

Altera/nVidia/PNStack

  [+] Had a number of very helpful converstions with Ross to identify
  enhancements needed before we can proliferate PNStack use for general
  custom digital automation. I am using a snapshot of Ross's example
  (PNSTACK2) to help reproduce the issues we have seen and discussed
  together. Thanks to Mirko, too, for his help narrowing down the issue
  with bbox computation of a sub-ucell PNStack. My attempts to reproduce
  Mirko's workaround hit a snag. Investigating further.

  [+] Prepared a larger PNStack test-case to help look into multi-row
  support (STAR: 9000748424- PNStack fix width option is not honored (for
  multi-row support).) Not being too large, it runs in a few minutes, but,
  it is still large enough so that we can see some interesting behavior
  with 3 or 4 rows. It should be a good test case to help develop futher this
  feature. 

Intel/PackedPartition
  [+] Had a brief chat with Ross on this and the consensus for now is to first
  focus on PNStack and then come back to PP. Ross seems to be happy with
  the current Helix solution for symmetry (improved with recent
  enhancements in BranchClone and spacing control with OverlapLayers). When
  we get to it, we'll focus on making PP a seamless improvement over
  Partition (by solving the DRC problem).

Windows dev environment:
  [+] Installed cscope for windows and tested with emacs on windows. Works
  wonderfully! 

  [+] Installed and tried Visual Studio 2010. It fails in cmake
  santana. Installed and tried latest version of cmake, but it fails in santana.
  Switched back to VS 2005. That works in santana, but fails cmake on
  Helix. That's probably due to a problem in my machine. Will try Lilit's
  machine when I get a chance.

Windows/linux builds:
  [+] Good progress this week. We have identified and fixed a few issues to get a working windows build (opt mode only, but that's good enough for now :-). The hang issue is fixed (STAR 9000690552). It was due to a "system(date)" call which stops and waits for user input in windows, as opposed to the familiar/harmless linux behavior. Thanks a lot to many team members that helped with useful hints, especially Lilit -- without her machine and opt build, we could not figure this out. Further, Lilit also figured out that the root cause of the problem with debug build is python. We could plausibly use opt python but dbg Helix, I think, to improve development in Windows.
  [+] For me personally, this was also good learning about windows/power-shell/cmake/visual studio/etc.! 
  [+] On the linux build front, I enhanced my build script to check for QSC and set the net/apps root appropriately. Also, enhanced it to also support the release branch. The unification will save me from managing multiple scripts and save time going forward.
  
Altera/nVidia/PNStack
  [+] Investigated the Xgrid/Ygrid related error in nVidia test-case from Ross and provided a couple of recommendations to resolve it.
  [+] Requested an account in JP01 to test pnstack using new PCell Xtreme code to support SKILL callbacks. Still waiting in CCT queue, I think.

Intel/PackedPartition
  [+] No update this week.

Other
  [+] We had a storm pass thru Atlanta. Storm was over by Tuesday morning, and it caused much less damage in GA versus the tornado belt to the west, but still, it left behind many fallen trees, power outages, a closed day-care center (where my little son attends), and much closer to home (or rather our previous home, which is a rental property now) a collapsed carport and storage! Fortunately, the main part of the house is ok, and so, the tenants (with three little kids who saw it all happen) are safe.. It was a 115 year old Oak tree that used to be the tallest tree in my neighbors yard and came crashing down on the carport. In a few days, the tree debris is cleaned up, the remains of the carport is now being cleaned up, so there is enourmous progress :-).
  [+] A few meetings

* 2014 04 28
Altera/nVidia/PNStack
  [+] Investigated issue from Altera: 9000729574 (Nwell bridging not complete). Thanks to Yakov for pointing out the culprit (bridging shapes/mergeable shapes). Created an internal test-case to help speed up the debug and created related STAR 9000743670 (Row does not bridge nwell over a PNStack depending on overlap-layer). Joe had already fixed the issue in that in his sandbox (was due to a premature call to the code generating briding shapes). But, the new testcase at least helped me run the debugger in snps as opposed to berry in order to study the details of the Row code. Altera test-case also had an issue with snapping cell contents to the origin. After fixing both, we got a clean layout for Altera. Thanks to Joe for debugging and fixing both issues promptly.
  [+] Using the internal test-case, removing nwell from overlap-layers for leaf-level row (inside column) worked! Top-level row can now bridge pn-stack and neighboring columns. But, the same settings did not work for Altera's test-case :-(. 
  [+] Did code reviews for STAR 9000739709 (PNStack abut devices with different substrate nets) and STAR 9000729574 (Nwell bridging not complete).
  [+] Looked into reg failures in pnstack. Two kinds of seg faults. They were both due to the new code from Prashant. He fixed the issue promptly.
  [+] Had a discussion of new (skill) abutment support in PNStack with Ming and Rajiv. Next, I will test PNStack using Prashant's test-case which works without wrappers.

Windows build
  [+] Resolved various issues to get a windows build in my machine. Running cnpy, though, hits a problem (incorrectly looking at 64-bit location for pycell studio). Waiting for Lilit to address this issue. Also confirmed that the build in Lilit's machine has the same problem.
  [+] Windows build with vs 2005: encountered two strange issues: corrupted dloVia_pvt.h file in build dir (just copied a good version) and const incompatibility in callbacks between mcp and Helix. Fixed the latter in my client (Joe later checked in the fix). 
  [+] Installed visual studio 2005. Apparently VS 2013 is not supported (getting a compilation error in santana)
  [+] Thanks to Lilit for pointers and the cni_3rd.zip file!

  [+] Had various "conversations" with Yakov re: bbox definition in Helix; run-time performance of SA vs GA; and force-driven placement

Intel/PackedPartition
  [+] Wrote the first draft of functional spec for PackedPartition. Had many good discussions and got good feedback for further refinement of the spec.
  [+] Cleaned up the schema for PackedPartition to remove most (all?) internal params. (STAR: 9000735789)
  [+] Updated one regression that failed due to the change to schema. Tar'ed the GOLDEN OA lib for the failed regression (saves about 140 files! Thank you, again, Varun!)
  [+] Further details below..

PNStack/nVidia/Altera: 
  [+] Cleaned up the schema for PNStack (STAR: 9000735789)
  [+] Fixed: STAR: 9000726723- PNStack - Spurious output in the terminal
  [+] Updated one pnstack regression (in PyHelix) that failed due to the change in schema.
  [+] Attended the sync meeting with Mirko and Noida folks on how to handle skill pcell abutment and new sdl flow. It seems likely and preferable that this will handled by encapsulation of all the handling under the primitive segmented ucell, and as such no client code needs to be modified. But, there seems to be some concerns and it is not absolutely clear that it is foolproof. There is still the possibility that a new primitive ucell is created. We are staying tuned and hoping for the former outcome (:-)

Constraint compiler:
  [+] Completed the code for STAR 9000727232 by implementing the fourth and final exception needed for this STAR: Ensure that each group has at least one element
  [+] Merged into the branch
  [+] Created a new regression test case to exercise the aforementioned user error
  [+] Cleaned up duplicate hxnet files and instead employ a symlink in test code

Details:
  [+] Did various experiments/investigations into the support of Halos/Islands. Clarified semantics/behavior for top-level vs lower-level halos, effective-area, rectilinear halos, etc..
  [+] Investigated how Row and Partition place Halos with OverlapLayers. Halos override. If there is a halo, it is honored regardless of the OverlapLayers setting. It is always computed by bloating the bounding box of its element (again, regardless of OverlapLayers). To be consistent, PP does something similar. However, griddingbox seems to be expanded by the halo, too! It is recommended that the users make sure halo values are on grid! 
  [+] Further investigations to confirm the following: PackingMode=Fast supports rectilinear halos and can pack better. PackingMode=Traditional rounds up to a box. The former ignores lower-level halos (can pack into them), but the latter honors lower-level halos, too. Did more investigation to convince ourselves that lower-level halo's are honored in partition/row even if the top-level constraint has overlap-layers. Halo is exempt from overlap layers (and there is no "halo layer" to add it to overlap-layers.
  [+] Had discussions with Mirko on PP/halos/islands. Thank you, Mirko!

Intel/PackedPartition
[+] Intel reported two issues on previous Friday: 1- no packing when OrientationTransform is used, 2- flipped instance.
[+] Verified workaround for the first issue (use of instance-properties) on eng7. We had identified and fixed the issue previous week. Verified that the fix works on the latest build. 
[+] For the second issue, created STAR: 9000731411- PackedPartition to support EnableXFlips/YFlips/Rotation global parameters. They were coded and disabled earlier. And now they are fully supported.
[+] On Thursday, they also sent us a number of inquiries, primarily to do with Halo support. Did some testing (of RP and PP both). Had good discussions with Mirko before and after the Intel meeting to help clarify the spec for Halo support. However, the actual behavior at the moment depends on PackingMode. Need to discuss further and clarify spec/functionality.
[+] Had some discussions and did testing on the new PackingMode option.
[+] Tested the branch build on Intel test-cases/usage models
[+] Updated my builds and confirmed regressions are fixed for PackedPartition/RectilinearPartition. Even with clean build, got a failure in main (2013.12 worked). Informed Joe who fixed it afterwards.

nVidia/Altera: no update this week

Constraint compiler:
[+] Worked on enhancing the constraint compiler to catch common user errors in PNStack (STAR 9000727232). Mostly done and checked in to both release branch and main. Will mark it fixed after coding/testing one remaining exception this week. 

Misc. coding:
[+] While coding/testing enhancement on CC, I had to modify an existing regression to comply with the new checks. Used this opportunity to merge Varun's tar file support from main to branch. Used that to tar the GOLDEN OA lib. Also changed the PNStack constraint in the test to have two groups and assign one to PRow and the other to NRow -- the constraint compiler now checks and throws for this, a very common user error costing time.
[+] Also, encountered a minor error reporting bug in CheckLVS module. Fixed and submitted.
[+] Finally figured out how to clean up my wrong "p4 copy" that mistakenly attempted to delete all files! Thanks to all who have informed me about the mistake.

Plan:
[-] Work on fspec doc for PackedPartition
[-] Tar all large OA libs in PNStack/PackedPartition regressions.
[-] Test LDE/density corner cases
[-] ...

...

[-] regressions: switch to tar files. Tried and got an error.. My p4 client setup seems to be non-standard.. Asked Mirko. --updateGolden may require a specific map..
[-] Remove the PackedPartition params not spec'ed
[-] ConstraintCompiler/pyHelix STAR
[-] PNStack/PackedPartition
[+] move from tier3 to tier1 disk..

[-] nvidia problem PNStack!
[-] email to Ross: nVidia, sub-row in PNStack Ming mentioned
[-] Small design -> RP, big -> PP
[-] Discuss with Mirko how SDL abutment handling work in Row -> PNStack
[-] Engagement link -> Altera
[-] Altera control flips (all PMOS flipped around X)
[-] Investigated PNStack spec on whether it restricts an allowed group to have only one type of devices. It does not seem to do that. In some cases, we may want to mix types in one row. This is currently the behavior.
[-] Make big_pn_stack bigger.. and FixWidth.. ~/helix/test/pnstack /tmp/bulent/test/tmp
[-] LDE and density support test (including regression)
[-] sub-row alignment spec
[-] Altera – gridded guard-rings support test and TWell support test

Intel:
[+] Did further testing on eng7. Encountered a bug and filed it as: STAR:
9000728478- PackedPartition does not pack into the whitespace within an
OrientationTransform. Joe fixed it promptly. Did code review of the fix. 

Constraint-compiler:
[+] Enhanced constraint compiler to fix STAR: 9000726140- PNStack -
Incorrect element names in PRow/NRow cause segmentation fault. Also
integrated the fix from branch to main after passing pyHelix tests.
[+] Implemented suggestions from code review by Mirko/Yakov. Thanks!
[+] Read/studied the constraint-compiler code.

pnStack:
[+] As per Mirko's request, investigated switching PNStack to use
FormTerms::GetPinBox instead of FormTerms::GetPin. Did the code change. Ran
regressions for both main and release builds and checked them in.

nVidia:
[+] Helped debug issue with PNStack run by Ross. Was due to missing
assignment of groups to PRow/NRow. Need to fix the STAR on this sooner,
rather than later.

Altera:
[+] No update this week.

Misc.:
[+] FTO on Thu/Fri
[+] Meetings: Intel, Helix review, Helix group, 1:1s w/ Ming

Intel:
[+] eng7 related activities before shipping it to Intel:
   [.] Helped test and Q&A eng7.
   [.] As requested by Mirko, cleaned up the new test case to send to Intel. 
   [.] Helped Joe with problems installing eng7 (it can not be installed in elephant, but it works in husker). Joe in turn helped me calibrate PPart quickly to get a good result. Also, pointed out that the result is gridded indeed (origin is on grid, but the instance has an off-grid width and is flipped around Y-axis, so the lower-left corner was not on grid.
   [.] Based on further testing, created a new STAR: 9000726178- PackedPartition creates incorrect results (not packed and/or not gridded). Helped Mirko and Joe reproduce it. Later, reviewed the fix for 9000726178. Recommended to check into main and work on a longer-term solution. 
   [.] Did further testing using OrientationTransform and a simpler macro layout, found more issues, informed Joe and provided a test-case.
[+] Came up with a draft plan as requested by Ming on a comparative benchmarking of RP vs PP and had various discussions on the topic. 

Altera:
[+] Created and packaged a new test-case on density. Made sure that EnableDensity param indeed creates a different PNStack with larger spacing gaps between elements. This helped confirm that we have basic functionality working.
[+] As requested by Ross/Mirko, spun-off a few stars based on PNStack usage issues observed in nVidia:
   [.] 9000727232- PNStack to check that valid AllowedGroups are created/assigned to P/NRows
   [.] 9000727234- PNStack to check that contact rings are defined when twell param is set to true
   [.] 9000727235- PNStack to check that a valid net name is provided with P/NContact
   [.] 9000727236- PNStack GUI - AllowedGroups are not updated after "Add New Constraint" command
[+] Investigated necessary conditions for abutment in PNStack and informed Mirko.
[+] Had a discussion with Joe regarding custom alignment function in PNStack for Altera
[+] Created a large test-case to exercise multi-row in PNStack

Misc.:
[+] To help track the issue found by Ellen, created a STAR: 9000726144- PNStack with AllowStacking param has problems. Also reviewed the code before check-in.
[+] Learning p4 branching basics, commands.. Very helpful intro/cheatsheet from Iulian. Thanks! Also thanks to Lilit/Mirko for a warning not to check-in my branch. It deletes all files!

Plan:
[-] Investigate switching PNStack to use FormTerms::GetPinBox instead of FormTerms::GetPin. Requested by Mirko.
[-] Focus on Altera spec'ing and testing. 
[-] Review abutment FSpec in order to help enhance PNStack.

Intel:
[+] Created two new basic test-cases to help communicate with Intel and also test PackedPartition: 1) use of id layers for both OverlapLayers and GriddingBox, 2) whitespace inside array inst. The first needs to be checked-in and the second needs to be tracked with a new STAR. RectilinearPartition already supports it! WIP.
[+] Suggested a new option: OverlapPRBoundary (default: true) for PackedPartition. Had good discussions with both Mirko and Joe. Thanks so much to Joe for implementing it very quickly late on Friday evening to help get it ready for eng7.
[+] Wrote the first draft of spec/IPS on *Partition (Partition, RectilinearPartition and PackedPartition). Thanks to Mirko for constructive feedback and also to Yakov for implementing the --rect option in Helix.exe. Very helpful to save time in my investigative efforts!

NVidia: 
[+] Upon Ross's request, I have updated the following STAR with detailed description to outline and help reproduce the issues I know of, Also added a test-case (and changed the title): STAR: 9000719129- PNStack - Enhance constraint compiler to catch various/common exceptions
[+] Reproduced the issue with upside-down PNStack result reported by Ross. NRow height was set too low.. Updating the value helps workaround the issue. However, this is a bug we should fix to help improve usability of the constraint. Informed Joe, too.. Need to reproduce locally and file a STAR.

Altera: 
[+] Created a test-case to demonstrate lack of gate alignment in case of sub-rows in PNStack. Currently, it achieves rough alignment by using the BBox of fingers. But, Altera needs precise finger-to-finger alignment. The new test case has three sub-cells: 1) flat PNStack, 2) PNStack with sub-row to inst alignment, 3) PNStack with sub-row to sub-row alignment. Need to provide more info on how sub-row alignment is expected to work.
[+] Filed STAR: 9000723869- PNStack with sub-rows has a fatal (inconsistent violation error). This was observed before but was not reproduced. Helped Joe reproduce it in his environment (needed to remove his .helixAVP.rc file!) Fixed promptly by Joe. 
[+] Did a code review for new density code in 2013.12 branch.
[+] Had some discussion on the density test-case. It is not sufficient to test the behavior in case of a density violation. Need to improve the test-case (either by adding a big primitive DIFF shape, or by artificially increasing the channel length of some devices. WIP).

Misc.:
[+] Brief discussion with Ming on SDL-based flow and need to help code abutment support in row without pycell protocol (instead use new pycell extreme from Prashant and Rajiv). Need to read up on the existing documentation. WIP.
[+] Meetings: Intel, Naji's COMMs, Paul's all-hands, 1:1 w/ Ming, Team meeting, sync meeting with Ming/Joe.

Details:
[+] Please contact me if you think you really need more details :-).

Nvidia: 
[+] Did code review for nVidia abutment fix. Was not able to find an internal test-case to verify this fix. Studying a test-case from Lyndon to see how one can modify pycell code to emulate the behavior in nVidia skill pcells.
[+] Other than the PNStack issues, also spent some time to help debug the diff_amp crash. Was able to tweak it so that we got a stack trace pointing us towards the root-cause of the problem. It seems to be due to issues in a macro library (inverter layout) where pin masters are missing.. Bad references are causing the crash in the constraint which aggregates those cells. StructuredPartition originally had the crash, but also got a similar crash in Partition and in PNStack. Column of rows, on the other hand, does not crash and we are able to get a resulting layout. As far as I can see, we can use columns of rows without too much deterioration to QOR.
[+] Tried to reproduce the problem where the p-row is placed at the bottom of n-row by following Ross's directions. However, could not reproduce in my local testing. Informed Ross and asked for further input.
[+] Had a short discussion with Mirko on the Nvidia crash (bullet two above). Sadly, I could not give him a concrete and final cause of the crash. Is it a missing logical pin, or a missing pin shape? Sorry, Mirko. Hope you had luck reproducing it locally.

Altera: 
[+] Prepared a basic test-case for density support in PNStack, packaged and forwarded to Joe. It has two sub-cells which implement the same circuit: cell1/constraint=col-of-two-rows, cell2/constraint=pn-stack and both run fairly fast and in parallel. Thanks to Yakov for making me look more carefully at the existing regressions on density. I was able to use one of them as a starting point and added 12 nmos/pmos devices each for pn-stack to work. During my first look, I was misled by the shape primitives used by most of the original tests.
[+] Had a few discussions on S/D pin permutation. AVP does not support it yet. Can be supported thru pre-populating multiple variants for each primitive.. Need to test. Thanks to Mirko for providing pointers to code in RowPreCreator.cpp.

Intel:
[+] Attended weeky sync-up meeting. No new issues on PackedPartition. It is working for them, however, their testing with real data is still in progress. They want to finalize their work by today (Monday).

Details/Misc.:
[+] Added section to 2014.09 release functional spec on PNStack's support of Density Rules and LDE-aware placement [+] Finally did some prep and write up to put together a plan on the Partition Dilemma: to RP or to PP! 
[+] Verified Yakov's fix of crash in RectilinearPartition due to empty sub-cell after filtering [+] Wrote multi-source feedback for two more ex-team members [+] Built from main-dev to check regression failures reported by Yakov. Reproduced the failures. They were later resolved by Joe's updates.

NVIDIA: 
[+] Reproduced and investigated three PNStack issues out of four. Thanks to Ross for a quick overview of PCell wrapper code. Details below.

Intel:
[+] Prepared a number of test-cases and filtered them down to two to demonstrate the flat-macro bug and its simple workaround. Thanks to Mirko for help with simplifying/cleaning-up the test-case and communicating the test-case/workaround to Intel.
[+] Reviewed code fixing two Intel issues: flat macro and oa-cell-boundary handling
[+] Tested the workaround for Intel with eng4 which they are using now. Also tested the fix in main-dev. branch.
[+] A few discussions on PRBoundary vs oa-cell-boundary shapes in GriddingBox and OverlapLayers options.

Altera:
[+] Reviewed code fixing two Altera issues: LDE support and MatchDeviceOrientation option.
[+] A few discussions regarding priorities on sub-ucell and multi-row support in PNStack.

Details/Misc.:
[+] NVIDIA: 4 issues reported by Ross: 
  (1) abutment (9000719145, slides 5 and 8). Most time spent on abutment related investigation/setup/debug. Reproduced and help Joe to reproduce in chamber.
  (2) crash (slide 2). Debugged crash and found out that it is due to missing element in the constraint. Helped Ross locate and fix the constraint manually. This is another exception which can be handled best in constraint compiler. 
  (3) bad result (9000719129, slide 5), Due to missing row assignment. Another exception that constraint compiler can catch and report. Ross was able to work around it quickly.
  (4) bottom alignment option (slide 13). Need to investigate further.
[+] Ramped up on NVIDIA chamber. Set things up in the chamber to help Joe debug further.. Transferred eng5 build to help debug.
[+] Filed a STAR encountered during NVIDIA debug (crash upon bringing up of GUI). IT was due to access issue in chamber. STAR: 9000719235- Helix GUI aborts on start -up (due to OA lock?)
[+] Encountered an assertion-failure in RectilinearPartition. Packaged and forwarded to Yakov, who fixed it promptly. Thanks!
[+] Wrote multi-source feedback for Review Season for an ex-team member.
[+] FTO on Monday: president's day in US.

Plan:
[-] Update release fspec with PNStack details
[-] NVIDIA: reproduce/investigate problem with bottom alignment option in PNStack.
[-] Package a few test cases to help development of Density support in PNStack
[-] Intel -- review two fixes for Intel in 2013.12 before commit (handle flat macros, and cell boundary shape)
[-] File a STAR to enhance constraint compiler to check for incorrect composition (missing element: an element is moved elsewhere in GUI or by HFL). Investigate if the GUI can also be enhanced to handle the issue earlier.
[-] Add on to and check in the Intel test-cases so they can be run within the harness.

Team meeting in MV:
[+] Meeting with many teammates from across the world! Very helpful introduction to and conversations with everybody -- and the bonus of good food and good weather :-). Thank you all!

Altera:
[+] Tested the new package (eng5) with fix for gate alignment before it is delivered to the customer.
[+] Meeting with Lyndon. Was very informative to help understand technical problems and prioritize the requirements. Was very good to meet Lyndon face to face, too.
[+] Investigated DRCs on M9/M10. Due to user error and can be easily fixed by updating primitive layout in pdk.
[+] Tested support for sub-ucells (row/col), and dnw. Gate alignment to sub-ucells needs work. Next: test support for gridded guard-rings.
[+] Twell testing on Altera design is blocked due to missing minWidth rule for nwell in santana tech from Altera. Thanks to Siarhei for pointing out the new tech which has the rule definition.
[+] Contact ring testing is blocked due to OA error: Python Error: (OA) Unable to open library TechLib_intel73 at path TechLib_intel73: Invalid Lib Path. dlo.misc.pxi:1560
[+] Twell/contact-ring tests PASS on ADFF (internal test). There are some contact-grid errors, but they also exist in Contact-Ring constraint with one Column.

Intel:
[+] Had a meeting with Intel (Farrukh) which helped debug the latest issue and clarify requirements when oaPrBoundary exists.
[+] Created a testcase to reproduce Intel's latest issue and forwarded to Joe who promptly fixed it. Thanks and credit also go to Mirko! Great teamwork!!

Misc.:
[+] Had an internal meeting on PNstack future direction. The consensus is to solidify basic requirements: fix row (PMOS and NMOS) height and specify the nwell location (in y). Next step would be to enable NPPNNPPN pattern in multi-row designs. These will be prioritized high along with Altera requests to support LDE (coding done) and Density (in progress).
[+] Tested <cellname>.hxavpcfg functionality to help configure PNStack. Did not work. Joe pointed out that it requires a preceding "."
[+] Found a minor issue (causing seg-fault in Helix.exe): after creating a sub-row, PNStack NRow group still has the devices that are moved into sub-row. Need to enhance constraint compilation to check for this exception and flag as error.
[+] Found out that in the Altera test-case, two devices with same gate connection are not aligned (infact placed far away). MN16 and MP19: InstTerminal(TerminalName(Gate) NetName(vssexbxy_pm)). Investigated further and found out that they are pulled apart due to their soruce/drain connections. Should we prioritize gate connections higher in wirelength computation?
[+] Packaged two test-cases for Yakov. 

Plan:
[-] FTO on Monday: president's day in US.
[-] Intel: Test the workaround for new issue on eng5 package and communicate to intel.
[-] Intel: Test the fix for Intel's issue we have seen on Friday 2014/Feb/14.
[-] Altera: Test support for gridded guard-rings.
[-] Altera: Use the new tech from Siarhei with nwell-minWidth rule to test twell support.
[-] Investigate further OverlapLayers semantics in PNStack to help plan work on 9000666394 - enhancement to OverlapLayers functionality.
[-] Package a few test cases to help development of Density support in PNStack

Intel:
[+] New package (eng4) is delivered to Intel with fix for polygon support.

Altera:
[+] Looked into 3 new issues reported by altera (received new test-case on 2014-02-03). Details below:
[+] Investigated the new request to support custom function for alignment and support macros with and w/o pins. For the case of asymmetric transistor layout, suggested an option to match x-flips (this ensures that both gates and flagged-asymmetric pins can be aligned). Tested the new internal config option provided by Joe. It works very well on Altera test case.
[+] Created two STARs to track showstopper bugs (both are fixed now):
    9000713136- PNStack creates bad layout when m0 track rules are enforced in santana tech
    9000713613- PNStack constraint is not written out correctly from the GUI

Misc.:
[+] Tested eng4 package on 3 Altera and 1 Intel test cases. Had a false alarm when I observed abutted shapes from sub-ucells. This proved to be due to lack of full understanding (PackedPartition does not enforce DRC between sub-ucells as per spec) and user error (not setting proper grid values to prevent such shorts) both on my part! 
[+] Investigated regression failure on the new test: fcm4_pnstack_pack_shapes. Verified the bug and the fix (a few files out of sync) using new builds. 
[+] Verified Kumar's fix for 9000713613 using main-dev on Altera's data.
[+] Did code review of the PNStack/PackedPartition related merges into the release branch.
[+] Updated LDE test-cases to use PNStack instead of PackedPartition. The latter, by spec, does not support rules between sub-ucells. Good news: There were some minor interface bugs, but now LDE-support is functional in PNStack.
[+] Started testing various PNStack features that Altera is interested in using in the near future.
[+] Tried fixing PNStack width to get multiple rows (with additional .helix_avp.rc config to use multiple rows), but, did not get a good result. The layout width is larger than the spec, and it folds NMOS (only) on top of PMOS creating: NPN. What we would like to see is: NPPN (four rows). This is a long-term request from Altera.
[+] Started to investigate OverlapLayers semantics in PNStack to help plan work on 9000666394 - enhancement to OverlapLayers functionality. Work in progress.

Plan:
[-] On-site for R&D team meeting
[-] Altera: Investigate and resolve DRCs on M9/M10
[-] Plan internal meeting for PNstack discussion
[-] Altera: test support for sub-ucells (row/col), dnw, gridded guard-rings
[-] Investigate further OverlapLayers semantics in PNStack to help plan work on 9000666394 - enhancement to OverlapLayers functionality.
[-] Package a few test cases to help development of Density support in PNStack
[-] Test plan to compare Packed vs Rectilinear Partition
[-] Update release fspec with PNStack details
[-] Code refactoring in Directives.py to eliminate global methods and re-use the base method. Thanks to Yakov for pointing out the issue.

Altera:
[+] Investigated the new test-case/issues from Altera. 
[+] Read code and had various discussions on three new issues reported by Lyndon.
[+] LDE support: Packaged 2 test cases, one for enclosure, one for spacing by re-using two existing regressions. Forwarded to Joe.
[+] Did various rounds of code review on Altera fixes. Had a discussion with Joe on handling oaArrayInsts with whitespace within them.

Intel: 
[+] Looked into geo module dep in DLO and discussed various ways to resolve it. This came about due to the fix for polygon support.
[+] Reviewed CL#40044 and tested the build. Found dependency to geo in dloBase. Pointed out to Joe. He fixed it in CL#40047.

Misc.:
[+] Had discussions with Varun and Mirko to clarify tar file usage in harness. Reviewed Varun's prototype.
[+] Had one day FTO on Friday

Plan:
[-] Altera: Investigate the new request to support alignment method/function (including customAlignment) and macros with and w/o pins

PNStack/PackedPartition:
[+] Altera: Did testing in berry patch, found an issue with bad abutments, and filed a STAR on it: 9000709116- PNStack has bad abutments causing DRC. Fixed promptly by Joe. Reviewed the fix; and tested the new build and package provided by Lilit.
[+] Altera: Reviewed the change-lists providing earlier fixes for various issues reported by the customer. Also received access to ICV runset and information on how to set up and run it (Thanks Siarhei!)
[+] Altera: Had discussion with Nishath, Mirko and Joe on weekly update.
[+] Intel: Investigated issue reported by Intel. Test-case they sent was not usable as is. Instead, created a new test-case to demonstrate the problem with polygon support. Filed STAR 9000709632- PackedPartition fails to use empty space in polygons. Fixed promptly by Joe. Did code review of the fix. Recommended to add support for oaPaths, too.

Misc.:
[+] Tested RectilinearPartition on the new test-case created for 9000709632 and forwarded it to Yakov.
[+] Had discussions with Mirko and Varun to enhance the test harness to support <lib>.tgz. This will help reduce the clutter in p4 reports considerably.
[+] Completed self review

* Review 2014
** SUMMARY OF PERFORMANCE
Bulent joined the Helix team during the last week of October and has focused on the following objectives during the last two montsh:
1- Improve quality of PNStack and PackedPartition (AVP-based) features
2- Ensure that AVP-based features are consistent with core Helix constraints (regarding support for abutment, DRC/rules, LDE, Density)
3- Help provide good support to early customers of AVP-based features (Intel and Altera)
4- Improve team dynamics by helping communicate between team members in MV and Austin
Comments by Ming Su*:
Before joined Heilx team, Bulent worked on ALX product and contributed to router team. He led STARC evaluation and completed successfully; defined ALX product roadmap for next year; worked with PEs to manage customer requests.
** GOALS FOR THE COMING YEAR
Provide high-quality support for LDE and Density in AVP-based features so that they are consistent with core Helix constraints. Time frame: before 2014.03 
Ensure that AVP-based features comply fully with the abutment protocol in Helix and rule/DRC support in Santana. Time frame: before 2014.06 
The two goals above will be measured by customer feedback (Altera and/or Intel) as well as a number of regression tests (similar to what exists on Row/Partition constraints). 
Work on Helix SDL flow in 2014.09 release and deliver high quality release. By Q4, 2014 
Support critical customer engagement by completing assigned projects/tasks and STARs with high quality. By Q4, 2014 
** DEVELOPMENT PLAN
Get involved with a variety of activities in Helix product to get a better grasp of the product-level details.
Continue ramp up on Helix technology and product. 
Finish reading up/studying/coding from a few good books on Python language.
** MULTI-SOURCE FEEDBACK
Comments by Ming Su:

Bulent has been focus more on higher-level problems in Helix, it would be great if he can also actually participate in writing detailed interface code and scripts.
Bulent has great positive attitude and it is very pleasant interacting with him.
Bulent is very knowledgeable in analog designs. He is a good communicator, and is very patient with people.
It would be very beneficial to Bulent and the team if he expands his programing expertize by mastering Python.
 
Comments by Bulent Basaran:
Thank you, Ming! We can also mention nVidia support and MSIP engagement/co-development..

-- This week
No OPEN STARs on PNstack for 2013.12 as of Thursday.
Got a very helpful overview of Santana/Helix architecture from Mirko. 
Had good discussions with Ross, Mirko and Joe on PNstack vision/requirements.
Was able to reproduce two new STARs from Ellen on PNstack thanks to help from Mirko.
Investigated proposed/suggested interface changes to dloInstance vs dloPhysicalComponent.
Had some progress in labs thanks to help from Ross who provided missing python code and some settings for HFL.
Had discussions and gave some info/pointers to Joe on GSP module from Titan (geometric shape processing, OR/AND, selection, etc.)
Built and tested the "route" module thanks to help from Lilit. Eliminated the warning message from unit test runs.
A few more sync's and incremental builds of Santana/Helix
Meetings: 1:1s w/ Ming, Mirko, Ross, Joe, 2:1 w/ Ming/Joe, bi-weekly Helix review, Helix group

-- Next week
Short week due to Thx Giving in US
Continue ramp up on PNstack, rectilinear placement and over all Helix flow and architecture.
Continue reading/coding python

-- STAR details
- Two new STARs (both resolved now): 
9000687695 the setting of PRow and NROW include sub-constraints (row, column) has no effect
9000687726 a case that helix enignee terminated with PNStack constraint

- One for the next release (2014.x):
STAR: 9000687726- a case that helix enignee terminated with PNStack constraint
9000681445 The cell high of created PNstack is expanded

* 2013 11 11 Mon
-- This week
Monitor and update STARs on PNStack (see details below). Also signed up to get emails on Helix STARs. 
Meetings: 1:1 with Ming, 2:1 with Ming and Joe, Helix Group
Had discussions on triple-well (twell) constraint and explored further with labs/tests.
Continued ramp up with labs, specs, documents. Put more focus on PNstack and rectilinear placement.
Did a few incremental builds after pointing to the latest code and editing a few files.
Started to ramp up on python (read some books, tutorials, try out some recipes). Nice language (:-)

-- Next week
Continue ramp up on PNstack, rectilinear placement and over all Helix flow and architecture.
Continue reading/coding on python

-- STAR details
STAR: 9000681282- When the width of PNStack is fixed 
  Auto-row splitting is not targeted for I2013.12.
  Switched "Target Release Int" and "Produce>Release" fields from I2013.12 to 3.2.1.
  Assigned to Kumar Sarth to update the GUI (to disable FixDimension(width) option) 
  Mark as related to 678325 (see below)
STAR: 9000678325- The cell high of PNstack layout does not listen to user definition without cont
  Assigned to Kumar Sarth to update the GUI (to disable "PN Spacing" option when FixDimension option is turned on). In this release, only height can be fixed and given a fixed height, PN Spacing can no longer be controlled by the user.
STAR: 9000667630- P/NRow in PNstack constraint does not support column/subPNrow constraint
  Seems to be a GUI issue. Re-assigned to Kumar. 
STAR: 9000681445- The cell high of created PNstack is expanded
  Minor issue. Infeasible constraint entered by the user. Layout is generated regardless. Needs further investigation/discussions. A warning/error message may help, but probably requires the layout to be generated first.
STAR: 9000683709- The height of Nrow in PNstack layout does not listen to user settting
  Marked fixed. Duplicate of STAR: 9000678741- The height of Nrow in PNstack layout does not listen to user settting.
STARs: 9000683800 and 9000683801:
  Similar to 9000683709
STAR: 9000684186- pnstack implementation generate layouts that different between platform
  Fixed by Joe.
* FIRST HELIX 2013 11 01 Fri
- This week
It is wonderful to be part of the Helix team. Thanks for making me feel welcome (:-). Looking fwd to meeting with you all.
Studying various things: p4, helix training labs, specs on PNrows
Meetings: Bi-weekly Helix review, Weekly Helix group
Reviewed 5 new STARS on PNstack and updated them
  Review and request more info on 9000681445 - The cell high of created PNstack is expanded
  Review and assign to Kumar Sarth two GUI issues:
    9000681396 - PRow/NRow group items should be keeping show in graphic editor  (Did not reproduce in my run)
    9000681284 - The behavior of contactType in PNstack should be similar as in topContactRing  (Reproduce with lab data)
Was able to sync/checkout and build latest/tot of santanta/helix (Thanks Mirko!). Ran santana tests (mostly passing). Currently running helix tests.
Completed ethics & compliance training
- Next week
Continue ramp up and help with STAR work..
* LAST ALX 2013 10 23
•       alx.exe
o       Enhanced lmap to handle cont as INPUT and dcont and pcont as output. It now maps "dcont" and "pcont" to whatever "cont" maps to. This is needed to output cont (create contacts in lay-b). Earlier, investigated dcont/pcont issue in chema (also fails to generate mols properly that solver fails) and forward to Sunil.
o       Discussion with Sunil regarding complex corner cases for abstract pin promotion and mapping
o       Eliminated some global variables and bb::mytime clutter.
o       Code to prevent overcrowding in libb (new internal options to turn on molcell, snapshots, flat layout, etc.)
o       Code to encap molcell/snapshot generation
o       Minor clean up in premols/mols. 
o       Turned off redundant dumps of alx db.
o       Discussion on OA data from GDS. We'll use cellnames (with $$) to abstract them.
o       Ran test flow on SCHMIDT from idt_an180gs
o       Started to put together a new unit test for alxdb/abstract flow..
o       Did some compaction experiments (using width-proximity bonds). Coded an internal option (g no_soft_bonds) to test solver/flow without soft bonds..
•       titan/titanOA
o       Fix titanOA issue reported by Rahul. Needed to make alxh lib incremental in order to use existing datatype names for internal alx layers that are added (used in molcell). The following error messages should be eliminated:
         ERROR: DataType drawingb does not exist.
         ERROR: Compile of configuration file /tmp/titanOA.exe.tmp.rdevmore.10_18.18.20.44/x_tsmc45lp_ipdk.cfg failed
o       Answered Rahul's questions on various complex OD scenarios.
o       Debugged problem with Shakir's run script.. Was due to wrong cell being used as arg to {alx add abstract cell} cmd.
•       other
o       ECO demo to Jt Li et al..
       Had various demo discussions with Sumit and Shakir
       Did a dry run to Shing-Te and Sumit..
o       Did training: Code of Ethics and Business Conduct
o       Did training: Conducting Business Without Corruption
* 2013 10 16
Demo:
Demo dry runs, investigate compaction in demo2. Tried hard-bonds and found
out that compaction does work already. There are some conflicts that the
tool automatically relaxes..
work with Shakir: investigate problems with experiment phase 2. 

Alx.exe:
Full flow functional with hierarchical output! Next add full support for abstracts and custom bonds..
Fix bug in api checking for false value for a g param. Thanks to Sunil for catching it on Saturday :-)
Refactor alx::migrate for clarity. Post-ops like hierarchy/via generation, layer derivation are encapsulated in alx::post_ops.
Improvements to g module: Clean up g2 (only use g). Also provide API: !g? (NOT of g?). Add auto-unit test as well.
Code for generate via and derive layers
Also improve debugging output
New modules: init (g param defaults) and misc (gen-via, derive-layers, etc..)
Debug info extended to show both alxdb and airdb.
Debug files now go under .alx run dir
Add check for device sizes in alx::migrate.
Clean up code for intra-layer check.
Communicated a rough spec to Mohit for OA cell modification (instead of creation in the last phase of alx.exe)
Good discussions with Sunil on how to implement/output StdVia/CustomVia in OA + implant layers
* 2013 10 10
Alx.exe:
Added bonds for min-width/area and diffusion
Added contact/via related bonds
Integrate hbonds code into alx.exe (call hbond generation code and pass them to the solver)
Testing: Resizing bonds are missing. Investigated and forwarded to Sunil.
Fix bug in processing re-used bonds
Investigate gridding iterations in unit test. Due to hbonds. Increased number of iterations to eliminate fractional solutions. Added g param to turn off hbonds.
Debug infeasibility unit test. Due to how new diff mol is created (to contain the old one in y-dimension). Relaxation works very well!
Debug bad bonds/mols: was a bug in unit conversion. Fixed.

Other:
Discussions with team members on ECO product demo..
Provided code to turn off abutment and spacing bonds on abstract mols so we can use custom bonds in our Zandro prototype experiments (and ECO product demo)
* 2013 10 02
Highlights for this week:
1.      OA object support: Good progress on polygon preservation including 45-degree edges.
2.      ALX natively on OA: Implemented scaling module in alx.exe. Next up is mol generation.
3.      Other: Continued experiments on ALX-autofix and put together a Zandro-ALX ECO product proposal.

Details:
1.      ALX on OA
a.      For the new scaling module in alx.exe, the following were implemented:
b.      Via Merging and Scan Line Improvement for speed (including Hierarchical Via Merging)
c.      Removal of dummy poly, dummy layers, rpodummy and clear layer command
d.      Alxcell search tree MTCL update (layer based)
e.      Error Message Investigation in test case: Found a dependency problem of DRC rule and Database clearance. Alx read oacell update for it.
f.      alx.exe regression test case setup for Noida Machines 
g.      Demo to Rahul for current working flow.
h.      Alxdb get numMols MTCL command which supports Hierarchical/Flattening Counting of Molecules and Via/No-Via Option.
i.      Looked into /test/alx/new_alx/resize test for checking/testing new resizing flow on alx.exe.
j.      Fix two bugs observed by Rahul (also enhanced the unit tests to check for them):
i.      1- simplify lmap setup and provide informative error messages
ii.     2- define global_parameters for backward compatibility with existing rule.tcl files.
iii.    Investigated a seg fault after working around the two bugs above.
k.      Code and unit test for alx::scale
l.      Code to delay sourcing of rule file until migrate call so we can properly reset atoms/rules db and then import rules and atoms in that order.

2.      OA object

a.      Polygons
i.      customized poly2rect conversion now ready:
1.      optimized wrt to previous flow, directly creates expanded molcell rectangles (earlier this was 2 step: gsp poly2rect, then gsp fracture/expansion; this should also improve performance as reported with bug#2768)
2.      support for rings in above algo
3.      testing exhaustively; couple of corner case remain where duplicate rectangles get created
ii.     checked default gsp poly2rect conversion and stabie
1.      both create significantly more rectangles for 45 degree segments (ex also with minSpacing used as step value)
2.      bond addition for such rectangles will be tricky
iii.    45-degree edge support:
1.      45 degree poly is broken into rectilinear poly. for some cases multiple polygons are created, example when two 45 degree edges are parallel
2.      additional molCell rectangles added for 45 degree edges
3.      rectangles to comply with minSpacing, minWidth rules
4.      multiple rectangle addition approaches, ex for multiple resultant rectilinear polygons (above)
5.      WIP when polygon broken in multiple polygons
6.      minimal rectangles added (to approximate 45 degree edge) (minimal additional constraints and solver time)
7.      ensures that rectangles within 45 edge boundary

b.      Paths
i.      Path bonds conflict investigation
1.      one conflict identified, for paths at times width is less than minWidth; Currently drc info is not considered for all path segments, but only for 45 segment rectangles
2.      other conflict between gsp.txt, nwello.txt bonds; to discuss
ii.     investigated failure in unit testcase alx/unit/t90_to_t65/driver. it seems input cell is different in the 2 builds; input is from gds import; to discuss

3.      Other
a.      ALX+Autofix on tsmc28:
i.      Tried to run on alx migrated flat GUC design. Hitting run time issue.
ii.     Will try to run on autofix hierarchical version of 28nm target design.
iii.    Ran alx to create hierarchical version of 28nm design, but hitting segmentation fault.
b.      We had many meetings to discuss product proposal. Put together hi-level slides for further discussion.
c.      Worked on creating alx testplan 2013.12. Created initial draft & asked to provide inputs.

2.      ALX natively on OA: Worked on support for cell cloning and continued unit testing
3.      Other: Two titanOA bugs are fixed: 9000647890 (crash) and 9000646533. 9000647891 (crash) is still open

Details:
1.      OA object:
a.      Continued testing 45-degree path support. Created STAR (enhancement) on supporting 45-degree polygons.
b.      Debugging 45-degree failure in Rahul's test
c.      Investigating ordering of import of cell db vs import of drc rules. Converting of 45-degree segment to mols happens in the former, but min-space offset needed to space them up is read in the latter.
d.      Added abut bonds for all rects of 45-degree seg to help align them on 45-degree line. Handled all combinations of orientation of the two adjoining segments.
e.      Investigated real design data (IDT_AN and DONGBU). Seems that polygons with 45-degree edges can be replaced by paths.
f.      Added user level options for symmetry and abut bond weights for 45-degree seg
g.      Star 9000656358 (Sato's demo designA) verified fix of GR paths using new path bonds. Still need to investigate two remaining incidences where path width preservation fails.

2.      ALX on OA:
a.      In order to support cell cloning in alx db, implemented cloning for: object mapping, atom info, cell obj.
b.      Added db extension for cloning and marking.
c.      Refactored code for uniform handling of device W/L
d.      Updated device report due to refactoring above
e.      Next, will add mtcl commands.
f.      Continued unit testing: Tried generating new resizing files on starc OA data, through alx.exe. Device.txt & table.txt files got generated. Analysed the output.

3.      Other:
a.      Team continued reviewing, asking/answering questions and updating of specs.
b.      Debugged Rahul's crash in gto top cell to AirDB::VerifyMasterResizeDevices. WIP.
c.      Validated fix for STAR: 9000647890- Bug 2957 - titanOA: crash in "db get cell children" command
d.      Also validated fix for the related issue: STAR: 9000646533- Bug 2956 - in titanOA {alx migrate} fails with tcl error
e.      Re-verified that titanOA still crashes later in {alx run pcell} due to: STAR: 9000647891- Bug 2958 - titanOA: crash in edbUnlockLibrary

** For OPS (from Sumit):
ALX natively on OA: coding device resizing and testing beautify
OA object preservation: good progress in 45-degree support
New resizing spec is published and under review
In prep for ALX review we had a demo dry run and a strategy discussion
Testing and improvements on Sato's test-case are in progress
Misc testing on titanOA and alignment discussions

** For alx-team
Highlights for the week:
1.      OA object preservation: great progress in 45-degree support
2.      New resizing spec is published and under review
3.      Testing and improvements on Sato's test-case are in progress
4.      ALX natively on OA: coding device resizing and testing beautify
5.      Other

Details:
1.      OA object preservation:
a.      Special mols represent 45-degree segs: edges lie inside 45-degree polygon seg. 
b.      Symmetry bonds are added to preserve 45-degree. Disabled min-area bond on these mols.
c.      Already getting good results in early testing!

b.      Got good inputs on the abstract/sch-b/resizing specs from team mates. Thanks!

3.      Sato’s test-case:
a.      Debugged Sato's libb where some gate straps and S/D straps are not getting enough contact coverage even when there is enough enclosure in both poly/diff and m1. The problem is due to incorrect spacing bonds between two m1 mols on the same net in a pcell when one (on gate strap) is covered with a larger m1 mol (at parent cell) which also connect to the other (on diff strap). Thanks to Shakir for filing a STAR on it. 
b.      Fix the problem in (a) in libp by updating pcell setup (disable poly_ext_lower|upper pcell.tcl and add gateStrapTop to pcell_pre_create_api).
c.      Investigated DRCs in libp after changes in (b). Need to fine-tune some pcell params. However, we hit some PDK init issues (polyDiffEncap does not work on some insts). Requested Sankalp's help.

4.      ALX on OA:
a.      no update yet

5.      Other:
a.      Testing TitanOA is in progress. Got a new test case (idt_an350) working and results compare well with Titan.
b.      Testing rect2poly conversion with good results. Found out that net names are not carried over from rect to poly. This needs to be fixed.
c.      Ramping up on alx.exe and testing "alx beautify" command. 
d.      Checked in a bug fix (reported by Rahul) in test unit test util (sample.tcl) to correct sf for given lib and tecbh.
e.      Discussed feedback to Donnie on slide on pros/cons of L4 and ALX..
f.      In prep for ALX review we had a demo dry run and a strategy discussion

Summary for the last two weeks:
1.      ALX on OA: drafted and reviewed an internal spec. Work in progress.
2.      OA object preservation: Drafted spec for path and 45-degree preservation. Coding is in progress.
3.      Investigated and resolved various issues reported by Sato on Demo test-case (two stage PMOS with large cap) with reference PDK.
4.      Created user doc on symmetry feature
5.      Misc. enhancements and bug fixes

Details:
1.      ALX on OA:
a.      Created standalone ALX executable (with tcl and oa)
b.      Separated utility code from Titan
c.      Direct reading of OA database in progress.
d.      Setup and lmap support in progress.
2.      OA object preservation: 
a.      Came up with draft spec which covers:
i.       new bonds to converge path segment width to a good value
ii.     ensure that W is even multiple of manufacturing grid
iii.    45-degree shapes to be preserved with symmetry bonds
iv.     MPPs with OD are handled when od has to be split into disjoint ndiff/pdiff
b.      Coding is in progress. Debugging various issues seen with duplicate bonds, corruption during path generation and air db dump mechanism. 
3.      Investigated and resolved various issues seen by Sato on Demo/ref PDK testcase.
a.      Guard-rings were not symmetric. Fixed with local compaction.
b.      Shared diff is too wide (libb has too much ext of diff over poly gate or too much spacing between poly gate and dcont, libp gets triple column of contacts). Identified missing rule setting (diff to poly clearance/interspacing) and added new custom/jbonds. Also enhanced the tool to provide new option: "air setv/getv fix_gate_spacing" to simplify finger spacing. Fixed major issue with Sato's demo. (Bug 2966 - setting fixed finger spacing should be easier (and it does not work with jbonds)) 
c.      Duplicate poly-strap contacts. Enhanced pcell_dcont_mode to also clean-up duplicate/partially overlapped poly-contacts on poly straps.

e.      Bug 2898 Bond interface improvements for debugging. In progress.
f.      Bug 2962 - how does air_pp_poly_ext work. Answered question. Resolved CR.
g.      Fixed aflow to create alxh (libb) preemptively in init (before chem-a/molcell gen). Helps to catch lib.defs issues faster..
h.      Resolved Bug 2964 - filter at the general tab in the constraints tab in the ALX GUI doesn't work. Typo in user guide. Provided the correct usage/syntax.

Need to improve path width preservation, support 45-degree shapes and complex od (OD shapes with partial PPLUS overlaps). 
Solutions are now proposed for all three problems and will be prototyped next. 
3.      Created auto system test (with cron job) on IDT Greendale data with LVS/DRC checks.
4.      Enhancements to make airDB independent of titan DB. Continued code review and modularization. WIP.
5.      Bug 2949: Resolved. Finished coding. Self-intersecting polygons and begin/end extensions are now supported.
Bug 2888: WIP. Finished bond infrastructure improvements. All required c++ API are ready. Next: update flow to do in memory updates of bonds instead of ascii file processing.
Bug 2960: Resolved. Enhanced code to copy port instance connectivity from Lay-A to Lay-B.
Bug 2898: WIP. Investigating bond debug improvements. WIP.
Bug 2963: WIP. M1 strap has wrong width. Investigated the problem. Provided workaround to Sato with a custom bond. Further debug WIP.

Nishath,

There is no update to the dashboard and customer slides. Please reuse the ones from last week.

We put out a high quality release after an intense effort of testing and bug fixing. Regressions and CR status are in good shape. However, there are still 90 open bugs in the backlog for us to process and make sense of. 

Mohit and Sunil were on FTO.

Did various iterations on release notes.

Cleaned up most of remaining cvs regression failures.

Responded to questions from Sato-san who is creating labs and continuing testing.

Restarting discussions on short term focus areas to align with Zandro direction and milestones.

Thanks,
Bulent
* 2012 10 11 new mode checked in. Also got new dummy device spec from STARC..
We now have a mode where we use new airdb to do chem-a, presize, scale, gen-mols, gen-bonds and then switch to old airdb..
In hflow, it first uses old vf to do pre-processing and then switches to new airdb to do chem-a, etc.., and then switches back to run lp, lay-b, etc..
alx::new_airdb2 1|0
** 10/15 revsonic flow defn
Can we scope out phase 1 first?
Also, with and without pin/net connectity

Nishath

Subject: RE: Revsonic requirement
Nishath and Sumit, cc: Shakir, Sunil and Mohit,
 
Probably Sumit would disagree that this is a “simple” project, and he may be right... Please let us know what you think, Sumit.
 
 
Here is a very quick write up to get things started. Let me know if something is not clear..
 
We have two high-level tasks:
 
Task 1- GDS2OA
Task 2- Constraint extraction from OA
 
 
Task 1-
Input: 
-          GDS
-          CCI data (includes target SCH or CDL netlist)
-          Target PDK
 
Output: OA with “connectivity”
 
We import GDS into Titan (layout view) and CDL into Titan (hdl view)
Use CCI inst-xref info to map hdl cells to layout cells and map hdl insts to layout devices (leaf cells corresponding to pcells in target PDK)
Use CCI net-xref info to annotate layout instances: (e.g., inst M1 has 4 nets, inst R1 has 2 nets. We may not be able to do pin-to-pin assignment, but I think that’s OK for the purposes of this project. Task 2 does not require detailed net info. But, if customer wants it, we can use annotated GDS and insert pcells from target pdk to replace leaf-cells in gds and create logical net connectivity, too).
Resulting titan db can be converted to OA..
 
Task 2- Given titandb from Task 1, extract four kinds of constraints (any others?):
1-      Symmetric devices (look for centerline alignment…)
2-      Proximity for devices (which devices are closer to each other)
3-      Guard rings (which devices are surrounded by them).
4-      Alignment for devices (devices with aligned edges. I think Joe’s MCP already does this).
 
The output will be something like:
<cell0>
<sym group0> <pair <inst_lo> <inst_hi>> <self-sym <inst>>  …
<sym group1> …
…
<prox group0> <list <inst1> <inst2> …>
<prox group1> …
…
<guard_ring0> <list <inst1> <inst2> …>
<guard_ring1> <list <instx> <insty> …>
…
<align group0> <one of Top/Right/Bottom/Left> <list of insts>
<align group1> …

Let’s check with the customer whether they care about constraint groups across cell boundaries. That can also be done using the new airdb engine with full occurrence path info..
 
Thanks,

Bulent,
 
From talking with you yesterday, this was a simple enough project. Please explain the methodology and we can decide who implements

Hi Shakir, Nishath, cc: Sumit,
 
Can Sumit/Manjul own GDS->OA with pins/nets? I think this is something that can be built on top of GDS import and CCI code in Titan independently of ALX. We had discussed this with Sumit a while ago. Sumit, I remember you had some concerns. Can you please share your thoughts on this?
 
In parallel, we can have Mohit focus on constraint extraction (symmetry/proximity/guard-rings). That will impact his deliverables to STARC in the short term, but, that may be OK as we have other deliverables planned for Oct/Nov and Mohit’s work on symmetry can be shared by both projects..
 
Regards,
Bulent

Bulent,
 
Nishath is asking if I can set this up for Revsonic while i'm in Japan, ie, we set it all up at Snps and i demo it at Revsonic while i'm in Japan. Sounds like you need 2 weeks for hier CCI work. So I don't see how it's possible to do without compromising STARC timeline.  Am I missing something here?
 
Regards,
Shakir

I will call you in 30min..

In short, we can do this.. No major holes. We have prototype code to read in hierarchical CCI and gds to get things going.. We'll need to write some code to extract constraints that the placer can consume.

From our converstation Nishath, we will limit part 1 of the problem to whatever is necessary to achieve part 2.
 
So, we can opt for using simple instance containers instead of pcells since that's likely easier. Also, we do not need to annotate nets since part 2 does not depend on it.
 
Bulent, can you comment on this? Is this possible and what work is involved?
 
Regards,
Shakir

They’d like part I first, 
 
For part 2, the list should be fine

Hi Nishath,
 
Can we first confirm requirements for Revsonic project:
 
Part 1:
  Inputs:
    Schematic
    Hierarchical GDS layout
    Hier CDL netlist from schematic
    LVS clean result w/ CCI (hier and flat CCI) using GDS and CDL above
   
  Output: 
    Hier OA database with PCells, connectivity based on LVS nets and inst names
    Ability to establish SDL correspondence from layout to schematic (with automatic correspondence)
    Parallel and series devices are smashed in LVS, so similar grouping to be used in instance mapping??
    Layout geometry is unmodified
 
 
Part 2:
Inputs: GDS or OA db from part 1
 
Outputs: Various constraints identified, for example:
   guard-rails requirements for instances
   matched devices
   diff paris / common-centroid
   what else?
 
 
Regards,
Shakir
* The end
